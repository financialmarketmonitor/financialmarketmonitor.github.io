                We have lots to cover, but here is a quick overall preview of economic conditions so far and what we will be covering.

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                Let's kick things off with the week starting February 24th.
            </p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">

                Domestically, mixed economic data, including weaker consumer spending, declining confidence, and rising trade policy 
                uncertainty, raised concerns about growth momentum and the broader economic outlook.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                On the consumer front, the Commerce Department reported that the US economy (measured by real GDP) grew at an 
                annualized rate of 2.3% in Q4 of 2024 and reflected resilient consumer and government spending and a decrease in 
                imports, which is subtracted in the calculation of GDP. However, real consumer spending contracted 0.5% MoM, even 
                though personal incomes rose 0.9% in January, and the Conference Board’s February consumer confidence index fell 7 
                points to 98.3, its fastest MoM pace since August of 2021.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                Contrary to the fall in spending, however, inflation readings were positive. Headline PCE inflation rose 0.3% MoM, largely 
                in line with expectations, and 2.5% YoY on one hand. Similarly, core PCE rose 2.6% YoY, down from December’s reading of 2.8%. 
                Improving the picture, wage growth has been exceeding the rate of inflation for 21 straight months, and we’ve witnessed 
                positive economic growth, a steady labor market, strong AI expenditure, and rising corporate profits.
                <br><br>
                Nonetheless, we’ve recently witnessed a mixed loss of momentum, after January retail sales declined more than expected, 
                the S&P PMI fell in contraction for the first time in two years, initial jobless claims rose, and the spread between the 
                10Y and 3M Treasury yields turned negative. For reference, banks typically borrow short-term and lend long-term, so 
                lending becomes less profitable, credit conditions tighten, and economic activity typically slows when short-term rates 
                exceed long-term rates. Alongside the economic data points mentioned, most headlines have highlighted layoff 
                uncertainties, spending cuts, and extreme tariffs.
                <br><br>
                Imposing levies on foreign nations remains a fundamental part of the administration’s agenda, with the majority of its 
                reasoning centered on encouraging businesses to build factories and create jobs in the US in the long run, as well as 
                gaining leverage in trade negotiations. In the short run, however, elevated trade policy uncertainty is starting to 
                weigh on sentiment. Not only that but if it persists, it may prompt businesses to defer or cancel investments and prompt 
                consumers to pull back on spending. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                With tariffs in mind, let's now jump over to other international developments.

                Data so far has painted a mixed picture for inflation in Europe, with it holding steady at 2.8% in Germany (above estimates 
                of 2.7%), YoY CPI growth holding steady at 1.7% in Italy (below expectations), and the EU-harmonized inflation rate falling 
                to a four-year low of 0.9% from 1.8%. Nonetheless, ECB’s January meeting minutes previously indicated that policymakers were 
                confident that inflation was heading back to the 2% target, and the ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey indicated that, in 
                January, consumer views on future inflation for the years to come eased.
                <br><br>
                In Germany, final GDP estimates confirmed that the economy contracted 0.2% in A4 of 2024, while France’s economy shrank 0.1%, 
                and the conservative alliance of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) and the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) 
                won the national election in Germany with 28.5% of the vote, falling short of an overall majority.
                <br><br>
                Few reports or data points were released this week in England, but the Nationwide Building Society said UK house prices rose 
                in January by a stronger-than-expected 0.4% MoM and housing demand has been stimulated by falling borrowing costs.

                In Japan, the BoJ’s Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated that they would increase their JGB purchases in response to any abnormal 
                rise in yields, which have continued to make record highs recently, and closely watch how inflation, economic growth, 
                and the labor market develop alongside forecasts. In terms of further progress though, the Tokyo-area core CPI rose 2.2% 
                YoY in February, below expectations of 2.3% and down from 2.5% in January. This particular slowdown was caused by a renewal 
                of government subsidies to offset energy costs.
                <br><br>
                Across the East China Sea, China, at this point, was under pressure as the Trump administration imposed a 10% tariff 
                on all Chinese products that went into effect on February 4th and an additional 10% levy on Chinese imports effective March 
                4th. Not only that, but the administration also plans to tighten semiconductor export restrictions against China and has 
                directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US to restrict Chinese investments in key domestic sectors like technology 
                and energy. In response, a Ministry of Commerce spokesperson stated that China will “counter with all necessary measures 
                to defend its legitimate rights and interests.” With that said, China’s Two Sessions, “an annual political event in which 
                Beijing unveils its economic priorities and targets for the coming year” also took place starting March 4th and 5th and 
                ended a week or so ago, but we’ll dive deeper into its summary shortly.

                As a result of continued policy uncertainty damping growth sentiments, the dollar depreciated and experienced its biggest weekly 
                decline since November 2022, relative to other major currencies. Similarly, the euro posted its biggest weekly gain against the 
                dollar since 2009 after recent announcements for increased stimulus spending.

                On the tariff front, the US announced various exemptions and delays for previously announced tariffs (25% on Canadian and Mexican 
                imports and 10% on Chinese imports). Nonetheless, as companies look to build inventory out, imports have risen, and as a 
                result, the Atlanta Fed GDP tracker has dropped from a projected 3.9% annualized Q1 growth rate and now points to a -2.4% 
                rate. Not only that but consumption, a portion making up 70% of the nation’s GDP, is now forecasted to slow to about 0.4% 
                for Q1 after being as high as 4.1% earlier in the year.
                <br><br>
                As a result, domestic markets seem to have taken a defensive posture, with technology and consumer discretionary taking a 
                substantial hit and sectors like energy, utilities, and healthcare leading. In addition, Treasury yields have moved lower 
                since January, in part because additional Fed rate cuts have been priced in and investors have flocked to fixed-income and 
                European and Chinese equities.

                The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) also released its widely known manufacturing PMI and services PMI readings for 
                February, revealing a decline in manufacturing while services showed growth. The manufacturing index dropped 0.6% MoM to 
                50.3%, the new orders component fell 6.5% MoM to 48.6%, and the prices component surged 7.5% MoM to 62.4%. On the other hand, 
                the services index rose 0.7% MoM to 53.5%, the eighth consecutive month of expansion, and the services employment index rose 
                1.6% to 53.9%, the highest reading since December 2021. The Chair of the ISM Services Business Survey Committee also noted 
                that “February was the third month in a row with all four subindices that directly factor into the services PMI — business 
                activity, new orders, employment, and supplier deliveries — in expansion territory.
                <br><br>
                Providing a summary of economic conditions within districts across the nation and further highlighting a mixed economic 
                landscape, the Federal Reserve also released its Beige Book. While overall activity rose slightly since mid-January, six 
                districts reported no change, four saw modest to moderate growth, and two experienced slight contractions. Consumer spending 
                declined overall, as solid demand for essentials was offset by weaker discretionary spending, particularly among lower-income 
                shoppers. Meanwhile, manufacturing activity saw slight to modest gains despite concerns about potential trade policy changes. 
                Banking activity rose slightly, while real estate markets continued to face inventory constraints. This contributed to a 
                modest decline in construction across both residential and nonresidential sectors. Agricultural conditions also deteriorated 
                somewhat, yet despite these mixed signals, economic expectations remained cautiously optimistic. Fed Chair Jerome Powell 
                referenced heightened uncertainty regarding trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation, emphasizing that policymakers 
                will “wait for greater clarity” before adjusting monetary policy.

                On a side note, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics also indicated a stable labor market, reporting that total nonfarm payroll 
                employment rose by 151,000 in February, and the unemployment rate changed little at 4.1% percent. In particular, employment 
                rose in healthcare, financial activities, transportation and warehousing, and social assistance, while federal government 
                employment saw a decline.

                In terms of rates, the ECB cut its key deposit rate by 0.25% to 2.5%, marking the sixth policy meeting rate cut in a row and 
                in response to recently weak economic growth and rising geopolitical tensions that have prompted increased infrastructure and 
                defense spending. The prospect of increased spending particularly helped to moderate losses against uncertainty about US 
                trade policy that have weighed on investor sentiment and have prompted the ECB to lower its forecasts for eurozone economic 
                growth to 0.9% for 2025 and raise its forecasts for inflation to 2.3% for 2025 (up from the previously projected 2.1% last 
                quarter). In the short run, however, annual inflation in the eurozone slowed 0.1% MoM to 2.4% in January, and the core rate, 
                which excludes volatile energy and non-alcoholic beverage prices, also fell 0.1% MoM to 2.6%.
                <br><br>
                In response to recent announcements made by the Trump administration specifically, EU leaders have also cited concerns about 
                diminished US military support and voiced support for a plan to collectively borrow EUR 150B to boost military spending.

                In Germany, Friedrich Merz’s conservative alliance and the Social Democratic Party constructed proposals that were presented to 
                parliament and involved establishing a EUR 500 billion off-balance sheet infrastructure fund, exempting defense spending 
                exceeding 1% of GDP from the constitutional borrowing limit, and easing debt restrictions for states. Following the 
                announcement, Germany’s 10Y Bund yield saw its largest single-day increase since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1990.

                On an unrelated note, the Bank of England reported that net mortgage lending rose GBP 864M to GBP 4.207B in January, the most 
                since September of 2022, with a temporary reduction in stamp duty that expires at the end of March leading first-time homebuyers 
                to capitalize on the short-term tax benefit. For reference, stamp duty is a tax paid by homebuyers in the UK based on the property's 
                purchase price, with rates varying depending on the property's value.

                In Japan, economic conditions thus far were positive, with the government likely ready to announce the end of long-term price deflation 
                and Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa recently stating that all the indicators used to assess deflation have turned positive. 
                Interest rate hikes remain in the picture and will likely take place if forecasts are realized, including signs of sustainable
                 wage growth that support the nation’s economic recovery.
                <br><br><br>
                Let’s now dive into China's Two Sessions, an event we referenced a few slides back that unveils the nation’s economic priorities and 
                targets for this year.
                <br><br>
                Overall, China has set an ambitious GDP growth target of “around 5%” for the year, aligning with its goal to double the economy’s 
                size by 2035 but contrary to prior economic projections that have called for a more modest 4.5% - 4.6% growth due to weak domestic demand 
                and trade tensions. Nonetheless, such confidence has been fueled by the strong global demand for Chinese exports and plans for increased fiscal 
                spending and special bond issuance. In addition to the growth goals mentioned, another priority remains to boost consumption by increasing 
                incomes, expanding employment, reducing financial burdens, and centering on trade-in programs and service sectors.
                <br><br>
                With that said, technological innovation remains a major priority as well, with a specific focus on biomanufacturing, quantum technology, 
                embodied AI, and 6G telecommunications. The government, so far, has even announced a RMB 1T national venture capital fund meant to upgrade 
                traditional industries and expand AI applications.
                <br><br>
                Considering that tariffs have taken headlines and remain an area of concern not only domestically but also abroad, Beijing has also released 
                trade-related plans. In terms of stabilizing trade, the government plans to “expand export credit insurance, improve financial services, and 
                boost cross-border e-commerce”. It also hopes to build new trade agreements and address price competition and production concerns by reducing 
                steel output and promoting orderly development in key industries like electric vehicles and solar. Concerning foreign investments, the nation 
                also hopes to improve the business landscape by enhancing free trade zones, ensuring equal treatment for foreign enterprises, and optimizing 
                visa policies and support services for foreign talent.

                Domestically, the markets not only continued to digest the latest back-and-forth over tariffs and geopolitical concerns but also the prospect 
                of a partial US government shutdown as lawmakers and the White House dueled over a funding bill.

                In terms of economic data, the Labor Department's recent CPI report revealed that consumer prices increased 0.2% month-over-month in February, 
                and Core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, rose 3.1% year-over-year, the slowest annual rise since April 2021. Both figures came in 
                below expectations, easing concerns about stagflation. Similarly, the headline PPI was unchanged from the previous month, and core PPI 
                declined for the first time since July, contrary to forecasts for a 0.3% increase in both measures. However, it’s important to note that a 
                few PPI components that factor into the PCE index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, remain elevated.

                Not only that but consumer sentiment has also continued to weaken to the lowest level since November 2022, according to a preliminary monthly 
                report from a University of Michigan survey. The reading fell 11% MoM 57.9, marking the third month in a row of decline, and survey participants 
                also noted that they expect inflation and unemployment to rise, with year-ahead inflation expectations rising to 4.9% from 4.3% in February.

                Overall, while inflation prints have indicated a healthy economy, contrary to widespread growth fears, the markets have experienced a slight 
                loss of momentum on the consumer front. With that said, of course, policy uncertainty remains a focal point for investors, and definitive impacts 
                of any involved tariffs will materialize through data prints in the next few months.

                In Asia, amid growing trade tensions, Japan is particularly concerned about the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs of around 25% 
                on imported cars, especially as automobiles make up roughly one-third of Japan’s total exports to the US. Meanwhile, on the domestic front, 
                Japan’s spring wage negotiations secured the largest pay increase in over 30 years, marking three consecutive years of significant wage growth. 
                Reflecting these economic shifts, the 10Y Japanese JGB yield crossed 1.50% and hovered around its highest levels since the 2008 global 
                financial crisis.

                In China, the focus point since the Two Sessions has been stimulus and boosting consumption, especially as stamping out deflation and addressing 
                the housing slump that has prompted many to save rather than spend has been a central matter for Beijing for months now.
                <br><br>
                On that note, weak domestic consumption was further highlighted in China’s latest inflation report. The CPI fell a more-than-expected 0.7% YoY 
                in February, the first contraction since January of 2024, and core CPI, which excludes volatility food and energy costs, declined 0.1% YoY, its 
                first decrease since 2021 and only the second time the gauge contracted in more than 15 years. Similarly, the PPI fell 2.2% in February, its 29th straight 
                monthly contraction.

                S&P 500 earnings showed strong growth of approximately 18% year-over-year in Q4 2024, marking the highest increase since 2021. However, 
                earnings-growth projections for early 2025 have softened. First-quarter forecasts have declined from 11.5% at the start of the year to 
                around 7.3%, while second-quarter expectations have dropped from 11.3% to 9.7%. Despite this downward revision for the first half of the year, 
                forecasts for the latter half remain stable for now, keeping full-year S&P 500 earnings growth on track at roughly 11%.
