                It’s important to track the markets because they can help guide your personal or business investment strategies,

                We'll now cover these past two weeks, with a specific emphasis on the new governmental policies brought about by 
                the Trump Administration, the recent market disruption caused by DeepSeek AI, resilient domestic economic conditions, 
                mixed growth growth trends in Europe, and monetary policy shifts in APAC.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                Earlier this month, Trump indicated that he planned to enact tariffs as high as 25% on Mexico and Canada by February 1st, 
                enforce stricter immigration reform (e.g., ending automatic birthright citizenship, deporting illegal immigrants, etc.), 
                roll back regulations on energy production and use to increase oil supplies and decrease prices, etc.
                <br><br>
                On a side note, it will be in our best interest to monitor the potential inflationary pressures these actions could create, 
                and domestic energy producers have, so far, expressed an unwillingness to increase oil supplies out of fear of creating a 
                surplus in the market. While claims of “energy emergency” have been made, the US is producing energy in record quantities. 
                The difference between primary energy production and consumption has reached the highest levels in recorded history, 
                and the US is already the world’s largest LNG exporter and crude oil producer. According to a 2024 Dallas Fed survey, 
                production firms are also hesitant to ramp up supplies and production as they would need oil prices at around $64 on 
                average to drill new wells profitably.
                <br><br>
                On a more recent note, the US has announced new tariffs, including 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, 10% on Chinese 
                goods, and 10% lower tariffs on Canadian energy imports. The Trump Administration sought to justify such actions by citing 
                concerns about illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and economic policy enforcement. In response, Canada has announced 
                retaliatory tariffs of 25% on $106.6B worth of US goods (including alcohol, appliances, and sporting goods), Mexico plans to 
                impose equivalent trade measures, and China has promised “necessary countermeasures”. It will particularly be interesting 
                to see how all of this comes together and influences consumer prices on goods like cars, food, lumber, steel, and alcohol.
                <br><br>
                Trump also announced the Stargate project, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, Softbank, and MGX meant to provide up 
                to $500B toward data centers and other AI-related infrastructure developments over the next few years.

                Let’s now jump over to the recent tech sell-off caused by DeepSeek.
                <br><br>
                DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that emerged as a side-project from a quantitative finance firm known as High-Flyer, recently 
                made headlines after it released an AI assistant that quickly surpassed ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on the US iOS App 
                Store. It has stood out amongst competitors as it has achieved high performance with lower resource utilization. While leading 
                AI companies typically train their models with supercomputers equipped with over 16,000 GPUs, DeepSeek’s models compete with 
                others despite only using approximately 2,000 GPUs. Not only that, but the training costs averaged around $5.5M, which, for 
                comparison, is roughly 10% off the CapEx by Meta (META) for similar technology.
                <br><br>
                As a result of its innovative approach to AI development, it disrupted the technology sector and US markets by prompting a 
                reevaluation of the global AI landscape, especially given that major tech companies have been dedicating immense amounts of 
                capital to AI-related infrastructure and R&D. Major tech companies experienced evident declines, including NVIDIA (NVDA) who 
                fell by around 17% (approximately $593B of its market cap) and marked a record one-day loss for any company on Wall Street.

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                With that said, let's look over at recently released economic data to gain a better understanding of domestic economic conditions
                as we end the first month of 2025.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                According to S&P Global’s first estimate of January economic activity, business activity growth slowed MoM but remained 
                supported by a return to growth in the manufacturing sector for the first time in six months and services activity grew, 
                but at a slower pace. 
                <br><br>
                Existing Home Sales for December also indicated that sales rose 2.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.24M, the 
                highest reading in ten months, even though sales for the full year fell to the lowest level in nearly thirty years as a 
                result of elevated mortgage rates and home prices.
                <br><br>
                On the consumer side of things, the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment fell in January for the first 
                time in six months, from 74.0 to 71.1, due to inflation and unemployment concerns.
            </p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                The Fed selected to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, as expected. Policymakers noted that economic activity 
                “has continued to expand at a solid pace”, while “labor market conditions remain solid” and inflation “remains somewhat 
                elevated”. Without much more progress on inflation or weakness in the labor market, we can likely expect to see rates 
                steady at the next FOMC meeting as well. PCE reports also supported the Fed’s beliefs of elevated inflation after PCE rose 
                2.6% YoY in December, up from 2.4% in November, and core PCE remained steady at 2.8%. On a side note, the Fed has made no 
                change to its balance-sheet-reduction program, with quantitative tightening expected to end sometime this year and serve 
                monetary policy easing.
                <br><br>
                Economic growth also came in slightly below expectations with Q4 GDP at 2.3% YoY and full-year growth rates at 2.8%, but 
                these remain strongly ahead of long-run forecasts. Consumer spending contributed largely to such expansion while downturns 
                in investments and exports were on the opposite end.
                <br><br>
                Overall, the economy has been supported by a healthy labor market, positive real wages, lower interest rates, potential 
                pro-growth policies (e.g., deregulation, tax cuts, etc.), positive earnings growth, solid economic expansion, etc.
            </p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Abroad, let's look at the Eurozone from a broad perspective, the UK slightly more closely, and Japan and China in APAC.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                According to PMI data across the eurozone, the composite output PMI rose from 49.6 to 50.2, indicating that business 
                activity has risen marginally this past month even though demand has continued to be weak. While services activity 
                continued to increase modestly, manufacturing remained in contractionary territory. More specifically, business activity 
                in France, for example, remained in contraction while the six-month economic downturn in Germany stabilized. The ECB also 
                announced further rate cuts, lowering borrowing costs for a fifth time. The key deposit rate has ticked down to 2.75% after 
                a 25 bps cut, and policymakers have noted that the disinflation process is well on track.
                <br><br>
                In addition to the onslaught of released economic data, insights on inflation and economic growth were also revealed this 
                past week. Concerning economic growth, the eurozone economy’s full-year growth of 0.7% came in line with forecasts even 
                though its Q4 growth fell short of expectations for a 0.1% expansion and slowed down compared to Q3. More specifically, 
                Germany and France contracted QoQ, Italy remained flat, and Spain experienced GDP growth, expanding by 0.8%. Concerning 
                inflation, the EU’s twelve-month inflation rate of January came in at 1.8% in France, remained flat at 2.8% in Germany, 
                and rose to 2.9% in Spain.
            </p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                In the UK, wage growth came in line with expectations accelerated to a six-month high of 6.0% in the three months through 
                November, but the unemployment rate rose to 4.4%, and the labor market witnessed the sharpest drop in payroll numbers since 
                November 2020 and a fall in job openings. On the housing market end, mortgage loan volumes were higher than expected in 
                December, indicating positive activity and demand.

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">

                Let's now dive into the APAC region.
                <br><br>
                Chinese banks have kept their loan prime rates at 3.1% and 3.6, and after a larger-than-expected 25 bps rate cut in October, 
                more monetary easing is expected this year. Nonetheless, negative signs remain persistent throughout the economy. The 
                unemployment rate rose slightly to 5.1%, the PMI unexpectedly fell to 49.1 in January, and profits at large industrial 
                companies fell 3.3% in 2024, marking the third straight year of declines. With this in mind, it will be interesting to see 
                how deflationary pressures evolve this year and how monetary easing supports the markets.
                <br><br>
                On the other hand in Japan, the BoJ announced their third rate hike in a year — a 25 bps increase putting interest rates at 
                around 0.5%, the highest level since the 2008 global financial crisis. They also revised their inflation expectations for 
                2025, with measures above the 2% target and upside risk. As a result, they have claimed that they will likely have some room 
                for further rate hikes throughout the year. On that note, CPI rose 3.0% YoY in December, up from 2.7% in November, while 
                core CPI  rose 2.5% YoY in January, up from 2.4% in December. Both data points met expectations and have supported a hawkish 
                monetary policy outlook.

                In these past two weeks we ventured further into the earnings season, with four big tech companies of the Mag7 reporting as well.
                <br><br>
                Out of the four, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) delivered strong results and beat both revenue and 
                EPS estimates. Tesla (TSLA), however, missed on both measures despite the stock trading higher afterward.
                <br><br>
                Let's briefly look over the companies I listed in <a href="/market-pulses/mp9/market-pulse-9.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">Market Pulse 9</a>.
                Netflix (NFLX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG), GE Aerospace (GE), Texas Instruments (TXN), American Airlines (AAL), 
                Verizon (VZ), SoFi (SOFI), AT&T (T), General Motors (GM), ASML (ASML), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), and BlackStone (BX) all beat earnings 
                (both EPS and revenue estimates). Southwest (LUV), UPS (UPS), Lockheed Martin (LMT), and Boeing (BA) all reported mixed earnings 
                (beating either EPS or revenue estimates but missing the other data point).
                <br><br>
                In these next two weeks, my eyes will be on Palantir (PLTR), AMD (AMD), Alphabet (GOOGL), PayPal (PYPL), Spotify (SPOT), 
                Chipotle (CMG), Pfizer (PFE), Enphase (ENPH), Uber (UBER), Ford (F), Qualcomm (QCOMM), Arm (ARM), Novo Nordisk (NVO), Amazon (AMZN), 
                Eli & Lilly (LLY), Roblox (RBLX), Monday.com (MNDY), McDonald's (MCD), Shopify (SHOP), Humana (HUM), Reddit (RDDT), Robinhood (HOOD), 
                Coinbase (COIN), DraftKings (DKNG), Applied Materials (AMAT), Datadog (DDOG), John Deere (DE), and Moderna (MRNA).

                So far this earnings season, earnings have exceeded analyst expectations and are on track for the fastest QoQ growth in three years. 
                Q4 net incomes are expected to rise 13.2% YoY, higher than the initially projected 11.8%, and seven of the eleven sectors are 
                forecasted to report higher earnings.
                <br><br><br>
                This also seems like a great place to quickly recap the fixed income markets.
                <br><br>
                The domestic investment-grade corporate bond market witnessed oversubscribed new issuances on average and total primary issuance that 
                met expectations. Following the inauguration though, the high-yield market advanced with above-average volumes while new issuance was 
                muted, meaning demand outpaced supply. In simpler terms, demand for both stable (investment-grade) and riskier (high-yield) bonds was 
                strong, but while the stable bond market met expectations, the high-yield market saw high demand with fewer new bonds being issued. 
                In part due to the technological developments surrounding DeepSeek, treasuries also generated positive returns overall.
