            <p>It’s important to track the markets because they can help guide your personal or business investment strategies, understand employment or consumer trends, grasp fiscal and monetary policies, and analyze geopolitical health worldwide.</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>We'll now cover these past two weeks, with a specific emphasis on the resilient yet uncertain domestic economic conditions, active fixed income market, and mixed Eurozone and APAC conditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Domestically, we’ve seen resilient economic fundamentals as we head into 2025, with positive real GDP growth, contained inflation, a strong labor market, and rising wages. However, markets are expected to be choppy in the next several weeks, with upcoming corporate earnings releases, the Trump Administration’s policy proposals, and the Fed’s updated outlooks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                Two weeks ago, ISM PMI increased MoM to 54.1, two percentage points higher than November’s reading, and the services component particularly increased by 6.2 percentage points to 64.6, contributing to fears of stubborn inflation.
                <br><br>
                However, this past week pointed toward positive inflationary figures. While headline inflation accelerated MoM, core inflation rose by 0.2% in December, the smallest increase since July, and core CPI came in at 3.2% YoY, slightly less than last month and below expectations for 3.3%. This indicated a pause in a recent trend of somewhat troublesome inflationary readings, leading stocks to climb and bond yields to fall slightly from record highs.
                <br><br>
                Not only that, but wages grew 3.9% YoY, slightly below forecasts but still above the inflation rate. This remains a positive sign for the state of the consumer even though December’s retail sales reading came out with a smaller-than-expected increase of 0.4%, compared to expectations of 0.6%.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                Two weeks ago, investors also absorbed positive labor market data after JOLTS Job Openings rose to 8.1M, December’s unemployment rate slipped to 4.1% from 4.2%, and nonfarm payrolls rose by 256K, thus beating expectations of 165K. As a result, 10Y US T-Note Yields surged to the highest level in more than 14 months, potentially indicating market expectations for delayed rate cuts this year. On a side note, Fed minutes from December’s meeting also indicated that most officials were comfortable with holding rates steady in January as well.
                <br><br>
                This past week, weekly jobless claims showed that unemployment applications rose above estimates to 217,000 from 203,000, even though continuing claims dipped to 1.86M from 1.88M the week earlier.
                <br><br>
                In terms of prospects, JP Morgan recently released a report stating that they expect the labor market to look modestly softer but still support growth throughout 2025, as corporate earnings and economic activity should enable employers to add an average of 150K jobs every month.
                <br><br>
                As a side note, the presidential inauguration is today, and it is important to look out for policy proposals surrounding tariffs, immigration and energy reform, deregulation, and tax cuts. Please feel free to visit <a href="/market-pulses/mp6/market-pulse-6.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">Market Pulse 6</a> to briefly review potential policy impacts.

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Abroad, let's look at the UK and Germany a little more closely in Europe and Japan and China in APAC.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                Eurozone painted a mixed picture for the European economy, with December’s YoY inflation rising to 2.4% from 2.2% in November, December’s core CPI remaining steady at 2.7%, retail sales barely growing in November, and the unemployment rate remaining at a record low of 6.3% in November.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, while the ECB has stated that disinflation has been well on track, ECB minutes released this past week pointed out that rates need to be lowered cautiously  due to potential global trade frictions, geopolitical tensions, and fiscal policy concerns in the eurozone.
                <br><br><br>
                The German economy, on the other hand, contracted for the second year in a row, after the government reported -0.2% GDP YoY for 2024 due to slow consumer spending, fierce competition that their automotive industry faces, and a drop in investments. The only potentially positive news was that these were offset by a rebound in private and government consumption.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                The UK seemed to follow the two somewhat similarly as well, with slight contraction but mixed signals regardless.
                <br><br>
                Two weeks ago, yields on the UK’s debt surged to their highest levels in decades due to concerns over government borrowing and economic instability. The 30Y gilt yield climbed above 5.45%, marking its highest point since 1998, and the 10Y gilt yield rose to 4.92%, the highest since 2008.
                <br><br>
                This past week also continued to indicate mixed conditions for the economy.
                <br><br>
                On the consumer end, annual consumer price growth in the UK expectedly slowed to 2.5% in December from 2.6% in November, and retail sales volumes fell by 0.3% in November, contradicting expectations for a 0.4% increase. On the other hand, services inflation decelerated to an almost 3Y low of 4.4% from 5%, core inflation declined to 3.2% from 3.5%, and GDP expanded only 0.1% in November, marking a recovery from slight contractions registered in the last two months but below consensus forecasts for economic growth of 0.2%.

                Let's now dive into the APAC region and turn toward Japan first.
                <br><br>
                Two weeks ago, the BoJ governor indicated that interest rates could be raised if economic and inflationary conditions continue to improve, although uncertainty surrounding U.S. fiscal and trade policies remains a concern. Hawkish signals from the BoJ this past week, however, raised expectations for raising interest rates at January’s monetary policy meeting this week, and the 10Y JGBs rose to as high as 1.25%, nearing the highest level in 14 years. On a side note though, real wage growth fell 0.3% YoY in November, marking the fourth consecutive month of negative real wage growth.

                With regard to China, while deflationary trends continue to remain evident, slight growth has begun to emerge.
                <br><br>
                December’s CPI rose 0.1% YoY, in line with estimates and down from 0.2% in November, and Core CPI ticked up to 0.4% from November’s 0.3%. In addition, PPI declined 2.3 YoY, slowing from November’s 2.5% drop but extending the deflation in factory gate prices for the 27th consecutive month.  On a positive note, however, services activity rose to a better-than-expected 52.2 in December, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global survey. In light of such data, the BoC has stated that it will implement a moderately loose monetary policy this year to support economic growth, including increased sector-based financial support and reductions in the reserve requirement ratio and interest rates.
                <br><br>
                This past week painted a positive picture for consumers and corporations and a negative one for the housing and labor markets. For one, Industrial production rose an above-forecast 6.2% YoY in December, up from November’s 5.4% increase, primarily due to higher auto, computer, and solar cell sales. Retail sales also grew 3.7% YoY in December, compared to November’s 3% increase, and the economy expanded at 5.4% YoY in Q4, exceeding expectations and rising from last quarter’s figures. On the other hand, property investment declines deepened to 10.6% YoY, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.1%

                These past two weeks' headlines were dominated by financial institutions reporting earnings.
                <br><br>
                Jefferies (JEF) kicked off after reporting that profits surged 212% YoY to $205.7M, though they fell short of analysts' expectations, while revenue exceeded forecasts and jumped 63% YoY to $1.96B. The strong performance, driven by a record $596.7 million in investment banking advisory revenue, signaled positive trends for the bank's larger competitors.
                <br><br>
                JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM), Citi (C), BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of America (BAC), and Truist (TFC) then followed suit. Most topped lofty expectations, with some even reporting Q4 earnings more than double than that of last year.
                <br><br>
                On a side note, TSMC (TSM) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) also reported earnings this past week. TSMC's Q4 earnings highlighted strong revenue and margin growth, driven by booming demand for AI hardware and advanced manufacturing nodes, along with impressive cash flow and capital expenditure. On the other hand, despite record revenue of $400.3B in 2024, UnitedHealth's net income fell to $14.4B due to a costly cyberattack, regulatory challenges, and rising healthcare expenses.
                <br><br>
                In these next two weeks, my eyes will be on Netflix (NFLX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG), GE Aerospace (GE), Texas Instruments (TXN), American Airlines (AAL), Verizon (VZ), SoFi (SOFI), AT&T (T), Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ASML (ASML), IBM (IBM), Apple (APPL), Intel (INTC), UPS (UPS), Southwest (LUV), BlackStone (BX), and Chevron (CVX). I'm particularly interested in January 29th, which I'm sure will be a highly interesting day for tech stocks.

            <p>According to FactSet, analysts expected that Q4 EPS for S&P 500 companies would rise by an average of 11.7% throughout this current earnings season. Also, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, S&P 500 dividend payments rose in 2024, with the net indicated dividend rate up approximately 46% YoY, and are expected to increase by 8% in 2025.</p>

                Let’s take a closer look at one in the FinTech sector.
                <br><br>
                Clearwater Analytics (CWAN) has announced that it will be acquiring Enfusion (ENFN) for $1.5B, expanding its investment management platform with comprehensive front-to-back office solutions. The deal, consisting of $11.25/share in a mix of cash and stock, is expected to close by Q2 2025. It particularly strengthens Clearwater’s ability to serve institutional investors through enhanced software integration, expanding its offerings for asset managers, hedge funds, and global clients. Not only that, but the transaction also unlocks significant synergies, including cost savings, increased operating leverage, and a broader global footprint.
