                It’s important to follow the markets not only because they help guide personal and business investment strategies but also because they provide 
                valuable insights into employment trends, consumer behavior, the direction of fiscal and monetary policies, and other key socioeconomic factors.

                Let's first look at domestic economic conditions.
            </p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">

                To begin with, there was an extreme market concentration at this point; US equities accounted for nearly two-thirds of global markets, with the Mag7 
                alone comprising almost a third of the S&P 500, and valuations stood around 1.5 standard deviations above historical averages. As a result, global markets 
                flourished --- China surged due to AI breakthrough and encouraging economic growth and inflation announcements, and Europe climbed under the guise of 
                increased stimulus. Additionally, reports from Bank of America indicated that the allocation to Eurozone stocks was the highest since July of 2021, to 
                staples was the highest in 18 months, and to tech was the lowest in 2 years. This was largely driven by the fact that tariff uncertainty was intensifying 
                worries over inflation, growth, and unemployment.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                That said, a few Fed officials reiterated that the impact of tariffs would be transitory, with short-term inflation ticking up but 
                longer-term expectations remaining consistent. However, the year's economic growth outlook was lowered to 1.7% from 2.1% in December, and PCE expectations 
                rose to 2.7% from 2.5%. In terms of forecasts, interest rate outlooks remained unchanged at this time, projecting 2 rate cuts for both 2025 and 2026. Nonetheless, 
                while the Fed selected to hold its policy rate steady at 4.25% - 4.5%, it also announced that it would slow its balance sheet reduction program. For reference, 
                slowing a quantitative tightening measure helps the Fed participate in bond auctions to replace maturing bonds, support bond prices, and contain yields. 
                This, in turn, makes it cheaper for the government to borrow and aids in bringing down our substantial budget deficit, helps keep mortgage rates and business loan costs 
                down, and eases overall financial conditions.

                Over the final two weeks of the month, several key economic indicators were released, painting a mixed but generally cautious picture of the US economy.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Consumer Activity and Confidence</strong>
                <br>
                Retail sales in February rose just 0.2%, falling short of the expected 0.6% increase. Compounding the disappointment, January’s initially reported 0.9% decline in retail 
                sales was revised downward to a 1.2% drop, the steepest monthly decline since July 2021. Consumer sentiment echoed this weakness: the University of Michigan's Consumer 
                Sentiment Index fell 12% MoM to 57.0, the lowest level since November 2022. Survey data revealed that a growing number of respondents expect worsening inflation, and 
                two-thirds foresee rising unemployment, the highest proportion since 2009. Similarly, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index declined for a fourth consecutive 
                month, falling 7.2% in March.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Inflation Trends</strong>
                <br>
                Inflation data signaled persistent price pressures. Core PCE inflation rose 2.8% YoY in February, exceeding expectations and January's rate, and PCE inflation increased 
                0.4% MoM, up from 0.3% in January.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Business Conditions</strong>
                <br>
                Corporate and manufacturing sentiment remained muted. The Conference Board reported a continued decline in its Leading Economic Index, which is designed to indicate 
                significant turning points in the business cycle. While the index suggested a recession was not imminent, the outlook remained uncertain. 
                S&P Global’s flash composite PMI for March registered at 53.5, indicating an acceleration in overall business activity driven by strength in the services sector. 
                However, this was tempered by a contraction in manufacturing and growing concerns among firms over weakening customer demand and rising input costs, the sharpest increase 
                in nearly two years.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Housing and Labor Market Resilience</strong>
                <br>
                Amid broader economic uncertainty, housing and labor market data remained notably strong. Existing home sales rose 4.2% MoM in February, supported by an increase in supply. 
                Meanwhile, housing starts surged 11.2%, reaching an adjusted annual rate of 1.5M units. In the labor market, job openings continued to outpace unemployment, which held 
                steady at 4.1%, while wage growth remained above the inflation rate.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Industrial Activity</strong>
                <br>
                Industrial production also surprised to the upside, climbing 0.7% in February and well above forecasts for a 0.3% gain. Manufacturing output rose 0.9%, also beating 
                expectations. However, this increase was likely driven by businesses ramping up input purchases ahead of potential tariffs and boosting inventories.
            </p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                With economic data in mind, evolving trade dynamics and their potential to further complicate outlooks for growth, inflation, unemployment, etc., were also brought further into 
                the picture, as the Trump Administration announced a 25% tariff on all non-US-made automobiles on March 26th. It would take effect on April 3rd, with auto parts slated to be included 
                by May 3rd. Nonetheless, given that nearly half of the 16M cars sold in the US the prior year were imported, the proposed tariffs signaled a likely disruption within the auto sector 
                down to the supply chains. At the same time, the Administration revealed plans for additional product-specific tariffs that would adopt a more targeted, reciprocal approach rather 
                than blanket enforcement. Countries maintaining low trade barriers for US goods could qualify for exemptions or reduced rates as well. That said, the projected global impact of incoming 
                tariffs stood at slower international growth and an upward pressure on goods inflation.
                <br><br>
                Despite heightened uncertainty and deteriorating forecasts, several underlying factors provided slight stability. For one, corporate profits were still rising, even if full-year earnings 
                expectations had been adjusted lower. Secondly, unemployment remained low, private sector hiring was healthy, and the potential for rate cuts lingered. In addition, pro-growth policies, 
                including tax cuts and deregulation, remained on the table for the Trump Administration.

                Amid rising global trade tensions, foreign economic conditions reflected extreme caution, though.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">

                In the UK, the BoE adopted a more hawkish tone, voting 8-1 to keep rates unchanged at 4.50% and emphasizing that fiscal policy would remain restrictive for 
                the foreseeable future to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched. Meanwhile, the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility downgraded its 2025 growth forecast from 2% to 1%, citing 
                expectations of higher unemployment and inflation. However, it also revised its projections upward for 2026 through 2029, suggesting a favorable long-term outlook. On a brighter note as well, inflation 
                showed signs of easing, with February's reading slipping to 2.8% from 3.0% in January.
                <br><br>
                In mainland Europe, the ECB continued to asses the potential impacts of tariff threats, with President Christine Lagarde warning that a proposed 25% US tariff on European imports could shave 0.3% off 
                eurozone growth in the first year and drive inflation higher by approximately 0.5% due to retaliatory measures and a weaker euro. At the time, however, the eurozone economy showed signs of resilience, with 
                the private sector expanding for a third consecutive month in March. Not only that, but in anticipation of lower growth, several countries discussed the potential for stimulus and eased fiscal policy. For example, 
                policymakers in Germany introduced a stimulus package totaling over €1T and focused on defense and infrastructure to counterbalance near-term trade headwinds and support longer-term economic growth.

                Shifting focus to the APAC region, economic conditions in China and Japan offered a similarly mixed picture.
                <br><br>
                In China, data releases pointed to a fragile but improving recovery. Retail sales rose 4.0% YoY, industrial output increased 5.9% YoY, and fixed asset investment climbed 4.1% YoY, all exceeding expectations and 
                indicating momentum in consumer and industrial activity. However, challenges remain: property development investment dropped 9.8% YoY, underscoring ongoing stress in the real estate sector, while the urban unemployment 
                rate rose to a two-year high of 5.4%. Meanwhile, industrial profits slipped 0.3% YoY, undercutting optimism around output gains.
                <br><br>
                In Japan, the BoJ held its short-term policy rate steady at 0.5%, citing ongoing global uncertainties and particularly the proposed 25% US tariff on non-US manufactured vehicles, which would threaten Japan's export-heavy 
                auto sector. Despite the cautious tone, inflation data supported the case for further tightening: core CPI rose 3.0% YoY in February, ahead of expectations, while Tokyo’s March reading climbed to 2.4% YoY, driven by surging 
                food prices, especially rice. That said, Governor Kazuo Ueda once again reiterated a willingness to raise rates if inflation and economic conditions continue to evolve in line with projections. As a side note, the 10Y JGB also 
                continued to rise and peaked at around 1.60%, the highest point in 17 years.

                Now that we've covered economic developments in late March, let's dive into tariffs.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                To begin with, why have tariffs stood at the core of the Trump Administration's announcement and policies? One underlying belief is that retaliation is a fundamental corrective to the long-standing differences in our 
                trade policies versus our trading partners' asymmetrical foreign tariffs that have boxed out US goods. Another reason is that the levies can ultimately bring in revenue, even though this, of course, relies on the delicate 
                tension that the higher they are, the lower the trade and revenue consequently. Nonetheless, the underlying revenue remains pivotal to not only the standard of US economic growth but also the fiscal deficit, especially as it 
                can help finance the administration’s planned tax cuts. The final rationale keeps long-term growth in mind and frames tariffs as catalysts for domestic reindustrialization, enticing companies to invest in domestic productive 
                capacities and thus contribute to America’s economic prospects.

            <p>
                <strong>What were the key announcements on April 2nd?</strong>
                <br>
                A universal 10% tariff to virtually all US imports starting April 5th and country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs targeted to 57 countries and commonly identified as “chronic trade 
                offenders”, a term describing countries with bilateral trade surpluses with the US, perceived tariff asymmetries, and other barriers to US exports.
                <br><br><br>
                <strong>What was the regional impact of the proposed tariffs?</strong>
                <br>
                1. The EU, with 27 countries, was hit with a 20% blanket tariff, and a few non-EU European countries like Switzerland, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina faced higher rates as well.
                <br>
                2. Africa, with 20 countries targeted, was hit with a variety of tariffs, many of which were higher than 30% but capped out at 50%.
                <br>
                3. Nearly all of East, South, and Southeast Asia were hit, with the highest rates sitting in the high 40s for countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar.
                <br>
                4. The Middle East, the Americas, and Oceania were lightly represented and faced rather moderate tariffs in comparison.
                <br><br><br>
                <strong>How were the reciprocal tariff rates calculated?</strong>
                <br>
                The underlying equation is (Surplus) / (Imports * ε * φ), where ε = -4, the assumed elasticity of US import demand, and φ = 0.25, the assumed pass-through rate of tariffs to prices. 
                For reference, this simplifies mathematically down to (US Trade Deficit with Country) / (US Imports from Country), and the final result was then halved. For example, the EU’s 20% blanket tariff comes from ($235.6B Deficit) / ($605.8B Imports) = 39%, 
                and 39% halved is approximately 20%. Essentially, this approach is tied to bilateral trade imbalance, punishing high-deficit trading partners who buy little from the US but contribute extensively to US imports.
                <br><br><br>
                <strong>Were there any exceptions at this point?</strong>
                <br>
                1. Section 232 Products (e.g., Steel, Aluminum, and Autos)
                <br>
                2. Copper, Pharmaceuticals, Semiconductors, Lumber, Critical Minerals, & Energy Sectors
                <br>
                3. USMCA-Compliant Goods (Canadian and Mexican imports meeting USMCA rules) --- Though this comes with exceptions of its own: there was a 25% tariff on fentanyl-related goods and a 12% fallback tariff if emergency authority lapses.
                <br>
                4. Non-US portions of a product are taxed only if at least 20% of the product is US content
                <br>
                5. Goods under 50 USC. 1702(b) [national defense exceptions]
                <br>
                6. Imports from Cuba, North Korea, Russia, and Belarus remained unaffected
                <br><br><br>
                <strong>What were the projected impacts of these tariffs</strong>
                <br>
                According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, both the April 2nd tariffs and other announced levies would reduce US GDP by 1% and lead prices and nominal wages to rise by 9.5% and 8.6%, respectively. 
                For reference, these computations were based on a global computable-general-equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated to recent trade data.
                <br><br><br>

                For one, US headline and core inflation rates for March fell below expectations at 2.4% and 2.8% YoY, respectively, and the PCE price index was flat MoM in March. Similarly, the April jobs report showed 177,000 new jobs added, 
                versus expectations for 130,000, and the unemployment rate remaining steady at 4.2%. However, the flash composite PMI fell to 51.2, with a decline in the services sector and slight growth in manufacturing activity, and the 
                Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index plunged slightly over 8% MoM while UMich’s Consumer Sentiment Index also fell. In addition, a tariff-driven spike in imports brought Q1 GDP down 0.3% at an annual rate, the first 
                negative reading since Q1 of 2022. While this rise in imports was somewhat offset by resilient consumer spending and corporate investment, it’s also prudent to note that this may have been driven by goods 
                purchases rising in anticipation of higher prices from tariffs.

                Also, aside from economic data itself, tensions escalated between Trump and Powell over Fed independence and intensified market uncertainty. Trump repeatedly criticized Powell for being “too late and wrong” in responding 
                to economic risks, urging immediate rate cuts to counteract the effects of his own tariff policies. In contrast, Powell warned that the administration’s tariffs are likely to raise inflation and slow economic growth, 
                complicating the Fed’s policy decisions. The conflict escalated to the point of debate over whether Trump had the legal authority to dismiss Powell or could find a way to obtain it. Nonetheless, Trump later 
                announced that he had no intention of firing him.

                Market movements were also highly volatile this past month. Following April 2nd and the release of the “Liberation Day” tariffs, yields unnaturally spiked, with the 10Y Treasury jumping almost 50 bps. Broadly speaking, the 
                main contributing factors to this included: foreign investors, notably China, dumping US government bonds, and tariffs eroding investor confidence by fueling inflationary fears and concerns regarding the fiscal deficit. Similarly, 
                the VIX index spiked to around 60. For reference, the 10Y grazed below 4.2% at the end of April and has since then climbed back up above 4.5%. The VIX, on the other hand, declined since early April and now sits at levels comparable 
                to the end of March. As a side note as well, gold rallied this past month, hitting an ATH of around $3,500, and crude oil fell to the high-50s twice — after “Liberation Day” and after Saudi Arabia signaled it may increase oil 
                production at the end of the month. Earlier in the timeline, April 9th was a particularly notable day for the markets too, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing 7.87%, the S&P 500 9.52%, and the Nasdaq Composite 12.16%.

                Kicking things off in Europe, the ECB cut rates by 25 bps, bringing the deposit rate down to 2.25% and signaling growing confidence in the path toward lower interest rates, even as trade tensions have clouded the 
                region’s growth outlook. Despite those headwinds, eurozone GDP accelerated to 0.4% in Q1, up from 0.2% in the previous quarter. However, not all signals were positive: the flash Composite PMI dipped to 50.1, reflecting weaker services 
                activity and stagnation in manufacturing, while consumer confidence declined across the bloc. Inflation also remained sticky, with headline inflation holding steady at 2.2%, slightly above expectations, and core inflation climbing to 2.7% from 
                2.4%, suggesting price pressures remain embedded in parts of the economy.
                <br><br>
                In the UK, a similar theme emerged. A softening in March inflation and weakening economic data has paved the way for potential rate cuts in the coming months. April’s flash Composite PMI fell to 48.2, landing in contractionary territory, 
                while the house price index declined 0.6% MoM, dragged down by lower demand from first-time buyers. Additionally, new mortgage approvals fell for a third straight month, and business sentiment deteriorated, highlighting persistent 
                fragility in the UK economy despite earlier resilience.

                Turning to Asia, the picture was somewhat more mixed, with Japan standing out in contrast to the softer PMI trends seen across Europe. Japan’s flash Composite PMI rose to 51.1, buoyed by a modest rebound in the services sector, though 
                manufacturing activity remained in contraction. Still, underlying economic momentum appeared weak. Industrial production and retail sales both underperformed in March, and the Bank of Japan downgraded its forecasts for both GDP and core 
                inflation through 2026. Despite these revisions, the BoJ held rates steady at 0.5%, as expected, while Governor Kazuo Ueda reaffirmed that further hikes remain on the table should the wage-price cycle continue to remain strong and the economy 
                stay on track with projections.

                On the inflation front, the PPI and CPI prints recently reported uneven effects. For one, April’s headline PPI fell 0.5%, the largest drop in five years, and core PPI dropped 0.4%. On the other hand, headline CPI rose just 0.2% MoM due to 
                cooling services inflation, and goods rose 0.2% MoM, which is surprisingly soft given the inflationary nature of tariffs. Looking at specific goods, categories like audio equipment and auto parts were up 8.8% and 2.2%, respectively, while others 
                like autos and apparel remained steady. Nonetheless, price increases moderated this past month. Broadly speaking, the disparities above likely reflect firms stockpiling inventories ahead of tariff implementation, delayed price pass-throughs, 
                and producers temporarily absorbing higher input costs.
                <br><br>
                In terms of policy, the United States and China recently agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs for 90 days while pursuing further trade negotiations. Specifically, US tariffs on Chinese goods were lowered from 145% to 30%, and Chinese tariffs 
                on US imports were reduced from 125% to 10%. In addition, the Trump administration announced plans to ease restrictions on AI chip exports.

                Despite these developments, consumer confidence has continued to erode, falling for the fifth month in a row and reaching its lowest level in nearly three years. With the consumer in mind, retail sales barely rose 0.1% in April, following 
                an unexpected 1.7% surge in March. The push and pull between easing trade tensions, softening inflation, and still-solid household balance sheets, wages, and labor markets has left the outlook for consumer spending and business investment 
                increasingly clouded.

                Aside from the data, Moody’s Credit Agency also recently downgraded the U.S. credit rating from AAA to Aa1, citing the nation’s mounting debt burden and continued lack of effective fiscal discipline. The move marks growing concern over the 
                sustainability of US government finances, though some experts argue that Moody's may be underestimating the true extent of the entailed risks. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, warned that the downgrade fails to account 
                for money to finance its debt obligations and emphasized that while credit ratings typically assess the risk of non-payment, they overlook the erosion of value that occurs when debt is paid back in devalued currency. On the other hand, 
                Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back and called Moody's action a "lagging indicator" that doesn't reflect real-time conditions.

                Contrary to the previously mentioned activity slowdown in the weeks prior, the UK saw a notable rebound in Q1, driven by strong gains in services, investment, and exports. This momentum pushed GDP up 0.7% sequentially, above the forecasted 0.6% and 
                a sharp improvement from just 0.1% in Q4 of 2024. Still, other indicators have kept rate-cut expectations alive. The Q1 unemployment rate ticked up to 4.5% from 4.4%, largely due to a decline in payrolled employees, while private sector wage growth 
                slowed to 5.6% compared to the same time last year. Despite this, BoE officials have continued to flag persistent inflationary pressures in the labor market, urging caution on easing policy too quickly without concrete signs of disinflation.

                Meanwhile, across the eurozone, March data offered signs of a potential industrial turnaround. Industrial production rose sharply across the bloc, led by sizable gains in capital goods and durable consumer goods, suggesting the sector may be emerging 
                from a prolonged two-year slump. Germany, in particular, saw output climb 3.1%. At the same time, the eurozone’s trade surplus hit a record EUR 36.8B, up significantly from EUR 22.8B a year earlier, particularly due to a surge in exports.

                Turning to the Asia-Pacific region, recent developments in Japan and China reflect the broader uncertainty stemming from global trade tensions and domestic economic challenges.
                <br><br>
                In Japan, the outlook dimmed as the economy contracted at an annualized rate of 0.7% QoQ due to lower exports, underperforming expectations for a milder 0.2% decline. This marks a notable reversal from the 2.4% expansion seen in Q4 2024 and was largely 
                driven by a pullback in private consumption, a critical component of Japan’s recovery trajectory. As a side note, it's worth highlighting that the 20Y Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield has surged to approximately 2.57%, marking its highest level 
                in 25 years. This spike follows a striking comment from the Japanese Prime Minister, who stated that the nation's fiscal situation is worse than that of Greece. For context, this is notable given Greece's sovereign debt crisis in 2011. Japan's public debt 
                now exceeds 260% of its GDP, and rising yields could significantly increase the cost of servicing this debt.

                Over in China, markets continue to react to the evolving tariff landscape and its implications for growth. As sentiment remains fragile, policymakers have stepped in with additional support. The People’s Bank of China recently cut the reserve requirement 
                ratio by 50 bps and the seven-day reverse repurchase rate by 10 bps to 1.4%, in a move aimed at boosting liquidity and counteracting headwinds from weaker trade outlooks.

                By the end of April, about 70% of S&P 500 companies reported earnings, with 76% of them reporting positive earnings surprises, but over 60 companies revised EPS estimates down, the largest amount since Q1 of 2014. Regarding specific reports, though, 
                the main focus remained on tariffs, consumer spending, and resilient AI-related capex. Companies more exposed to the former two expressed caution, with Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) providing soft guidance and weaker sales in China and food service 
                companies such as Starbucks (SBUX) and Chipotle (CMG) indicating softer consumer demand. On a side note, the majority of the banks and financial institutions reported lower advisory revenue alongside higher profits from sales-and-trading divisions --- equity 
                lines of businesses performed particularly well due to recent volatility.
