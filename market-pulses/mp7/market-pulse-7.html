            <p>There’s an extensive amount of events these past four weeks to unpack.<br><br>For one, Bitcoin recently rose to an ATH of $108,407.32 and Tesla (TSLA) did the same to an ATH of $488.54 as a result of various developments, including the basic post-election rally, Microstrategy’s (MSTR) recent endeavors, Elon Musk’s appointment to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), etc. In terms of MSTR, the firm has added approximately $17.5B worth of the cryptocurrency over the last six weeks and now holds around 440,000 of it at an average purchase price of $61,725 per coin.<br><br>Numerous domestic and foreign insights have also been provided into the labor market, inflation, the housing market, and general spending (consumer, corporate, and government).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Due to the recent high volume of domestic economic data, let’s jump into everything in a structured format — split between the last two weeks of November, the first week of December, and the past two weeks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s preface with the last two weeks of November.<br><br><br>The labor market continued to chug along even though the continuing claims four-week average rose to its highest level in three years.<br><br>Inflation trended downward for the most part as PCE rose at an unrevised annualized rate of 1.5%, versus 2.5% last quarter and 2.3% YoY.<br><br>The housing market remained murky due to interest rates and high prices. On one hand, New Home Sales plunged during October to a Seasonally Adjusted Annualized Rate of 610,000 (down 9.4% YoY), and the median sales price of a new home rose 2.5% MoM and 4.7% YoY, even though these prices are not seasonally adjusted. On the other, mortgage rates have been relatively flat.<br><br>Q3 GDP rose at an annualized rate of 2.8%, in line with expectations but down from 3.0% during Q2 and up from 2.7% last year.<br><br>Government spending surged at an unrevised annualized rate of 5.0%, which is up from 3.1% last quarter and 3.4% last year.<br><br><br>On a side note, the Fed and the Trump Administration also released relevant information. The FOMC released minutes from the November meeting and noted that “it would likely be appropriate to move gradually toward a more neutral stance of policy over time” Also, Trump nominated Scott Bessent as the Treasury Secretary, which has been considered good news for the markets as he could bring a more staged in approach to tariffs and a reasonable approach to national debt. Speaking of tariffs, the incoming president has now incited a 100% tariff threat to the BRICS nations and a 25% tariff on all Mexican and Canadian goods.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s now move a little closer to today and look at the first week of this month, which brought extensive new information on the labor market.<br><br>On the 3rd, the JOLTs Job Openings report was released. Job openings rose to 7.7M in October while quits increased to 3.3M, signaling sustained demand for labor and ongoing workforce flexibility. Also, hires remained stable at 5.3M while layoffs did the same at 1.6M, reflecting a stable labor market despite shifts in employment patterns.<br><br>On the 4th, the ADP Employment Report was released, which provides insights on private-sector employment and pay in the US. It noted a deceleration of job creation in November, as sector employment rose 146,000 (4,000 below expectations) and annual pay was up 4.8% YoY. Nela Richardson, ADP’s Chief Economist, also stated, “While overall growth for the month was healthy, industry performance was mixed. Manufacturing was the weakest we’ve seen since spring. Financial services and leisure and hospitality were also soft.”<br><br>On the 6th, a small beat in non-farm payrolls pushed out expectations for a pause in Fed easing into 2025 and cemented market expectations for a 25 bps cut this month.<br><br>Overall, the labor market is stable, with continued strong demand for workers and a flexible workforce. On one hand, job creation has begun to decelerate, with certain sectors such as manufacturing and financial services showing weakness. On the other hand, layoffs have remained low and hiring levels are stable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>It’s now time to review the past two weeks.<br><br>US Flash PMI, a forward-looking estimate of the US economy based on surveys of manufacturers and service providers, was then released on the 16th. The PMI Composite Index came in at 56.6 (up 3.1% MoM and to a 33-month high), indicating the fastest expansion of business activity since March of 2022. Along with it, the Services PMI Business Activity Index came in at 58.5 (up 4.3% to a 38-month high), the Manufacturing Output Index came in at 46.0 (down 4% to a 55-month low), and the Manufacturing PMI came in at 48.3 (down 2.8% to a 3-month low). The Manufacturing PMI particularly suggested a deterioration in business conditions within the goods-producing sector for the six successive months especially as production fell at the fastest pace since May of 2022. In summary, the Flash PMI report noted that economic growth accelerated sharply in December and reached its highest pace in three years, primarily driven by the services sector as manufacturing continued to decline. Additionally, despite a rise in raw material costs in manufacturing, inflationary pressures have slightly eased due to a cooling in service costs. As such, surveys have suggested optimism for a more balanced growth outlook in the coming year, bolstered by expectations of a business-friendly administration under President Trump, though concerns about tariffs and weak demand remain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>CPI was released on the 11th, indicating that consumer prices rose 0.3% in November — the largest increase in seven months due to shelter costs and a jump in food prices. However, investors found reassurance in the easing of rent costs and the fact that core inflation remained stable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Retail Sales were reported on the 17th, and they increased 0.7% in November and exceeded expectations due to strong sales in auto dealerships and online retail. Core retail sales (excluding autos, gasoline, and food services), in particular, rose 0.4% and signaled strong consumer spending through the start of the holiday shopping season.<br><br>The day after, Housing Starts were reported to have fallen 1.8% in November to 1.29M units, with a sharp decline in multi-family projects (a volatile area) and a 6.4% rise in single-family starts. While housing completions declined by 1.9%, building permits increased 6.1% to 1.51M units, suggesting a potential modest rise in starts in 2025.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>The FOMC Meeting was then held that same day (the 18th), where Fed chose to cut interest rates by 25 bps to a target range of 4.25% - 4.5%. However, they signaled caution about future cuts and projected only a 0.5% reduction in 2025, which is down from a previous expectation of a full percentage point. This is due to inflationary concerns as inflation has slowed but remained persistent, leading Fed officials to believe it will take longer to reach the 2% target — possibly not until 2027. On a side note, fixed-income markets will likely experience lower yields on short-term bonds while long-term bond yields could remain elevated. In one case, investors may flock to corporate bonds if the economy remains resilient, and in the other, credit spreads may widen if economic uncertainty lingers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>The Fed’s preferred inflation reading was released today, with the PCE Index coming in at 2.4% — above the Fed’s 2% target but lower than expectations. Core PCE also increased by 0.1% MoM and was up 2.8% YoY. Goods prices were stable, services rose 0.2%, housing inflation cooled, and food/energy prices saw modest gains. Personal income and spending grew slower than expected, with a dip in savings.<br><br>In addition, the University of Michigan’s December Consumer Sentiment report came out today and showed an increase to 74, which is in line with expectations and up from 71.8 in November. Inflation expectations for the year ahead increased from 2.6% to 2.8% even though long-term inflation expectations declined to 3.0%, suggesting that while the economy has improved, it isn’t fully thriving.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>All in all, the recent economic data paints a picture of a stabilizing economy still facing ongoing challenges. While inflation has moderated somewhat, it remains above the Federal Reserve’s target, especially with persistent pressures in housing and food prices. Consumer sentiment has improved, reflecting greater optimism about economic conditions, even though concerns linger for future inflation and economic growth. On the business side, the services sector is showing great strength while manufacturing continues to struggle, and retail sales have reflected healthy consumer and corporate spending. However, the housing market remains sluggish, with fewer housing starts despite rising building permits, and the Fed’s cautious stance on rate cuts highlights the potential for a period of slower growth and inflationary pressures in 2025.<br><br>Abroad, let’s look at the UK, Eurozone, Japan, and China more closely.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In the UK, the GDP report was released on the 12th and indicated that the economy unexpectedly contracted by 0.1% in October due to a drop in production output, marking the second consecutive monthly downturn. Alongside this economic slowdown, the risk of stagflation remained present. On that note, the CPI report was then released on the 18th, where inflation hit an 8-month high of 2.6% in November due to high transport costs while service inflation remained steady at 5.0%. Despite the rise in overall inflation, however, underlying price pressures remained stable and have led economists to believe that headline inflation could reach 3% in 2025. The next day, the Bank of England met and held its key interest rate at 4.75%, with an unexpected 6-3 vote split, and the Monetary Policy Committee emphasized a gradual approach due to rising concerns over persistently high services inflation and weak economic momentum. The day after, UK Retail Sales then revealed cautious consumer spending, as they rose by 0.2% in November, falling short of the expected 0.5% growth and following the 0.7% decline in October.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In the Eurozone, the Q3 GDP report was released on the 6th, revealing that GDP grew 0.4% QoQ — the fastest pace of growth since Q3 of 2022. Private consumption and fixed investment fueled the rebound while government spending slowed to 0.5%, exports contracted by 1.5%, and imports slowed to 0.2%. The European Central Bank then met on the 12th, cut interest rates for the fourth time this year to 3.0%, and signaled that further rate cuts are possible as inflation nears its target and economic conditions remain weak. On the 18th, the CPI report was released and revealed that headline inflation for November was finalized at 2.2% YoY (up from October’s 2.0%) while core CPI eased to 2.7% YoY (down from 2.9% in October).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>The Bank of Japan met the day after, selected to hold its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.25%, and stated that it expects to proceed with gradual interest rate hikes even though the timing remains uncertain.<br><br>In China, the Politburo has signaled a shift to a more supportive monetary and fiscal policy, prioritizing domestic consumption above all else and pledging to increase the budget deficit in 2025 and continue to issue ultra-long special Treasury bonds to fund major projects. They also selected to maintain rates unchanged, and inflation data released earlier this month indicated that the economy remains in deflation. CPI rose a below-consensus 0.2% YoY in November (down from 0.3% in October), core inflation edged up to 0.3% (up from October’s 0.2% rise), and PPI fell 2.5% YoY (down from last month’s 2.9% drop) and marked the 26th straight monthly decline despite Beijing’s efforts to boost domestic demand in recent months. Not only that, but geopolitical risks remain elevated following the US chip export controls week and the potential for higher tariffs when Trump takes office in January, which has temporarily led to a rise in exports to the US as Chinese firms have been frontloading goods.<br><br>In summary, global economic conditions remain mixed, with challenges and opportunities in major regions. The UK is grappling with economic contraction, high inflation driven by transport costs, and weak consumer spending, raising concerns about stagflation. In the Eurozone, moderate GDP growth fueled by consumer spending contrasts with ongoing inflationary concerns. Japan’s central bank remains cautious, signaling a slow recovery, and China, while prioritizing domestic consumption and fiscal stimulus, continues to experience persistent deflationary pressures and geopolitical risks.</p>

                Let’s now look at a few notable earnings reports from these past four weeks.
                <br>
                <hr style="border-color: #333;">
                <br>
                Week of November 18th
                <br>
                <hr style="border-color: #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;">
                Walmart (WMT) beat earnings and reported a 5.5% year-over-year revenue increase, 8.2% growth in operating income, and a 44.2% rise in YTD free cash flow (FCF). For FY 2026, it projects $705.28B in sales with a potential 1.25% FCF margin. The company expects FCF to rise to $8.8B, supported by strong guidance of 8.5% - 9.25% operating income growth, and it also recently acquired VIZIO, a leading provider of smart TVs and ad-supported streaming, strengthening its position in consumer tech.
                <br><br>
                Lowe's (LOW) beat earnings, experienced growth in its small and medium-sized home professional business, and remains optimistic about a future housing market recovery. However, it expects a 3-3.5% decline in comparable sales for the year due to reduced DIY demand and delays in large projects.
                <br><br>
                NVIDIA (NVDA) beat earnings, exceeded expectations, and reported a 94% YoY revenue increase, driven by strong demand for AI chips in its data center business even though growth has slowed compared to previous quarters. The company expects continued growth with a strong Q4 forecast, fueled by the ramp-up of its next-gen Blackwell AI chips, along with rising demand in its gaming and automotive segments.
                <br><br>
                Snowflake (SNOW) beat earnings, reported a 28% YoY revenue increase, and is forecasting 29% growth in fiscal 2025 product revenue. The company is focused on cost efficiencies and expanding its customer base through a new partnership with Anthropic and growth opportunities in the federal sector.
                <br><br>
                Target (TGT) missed earnings and reported a 12% drop in net income and a slight 0.3% growth in comparable sales. The company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to weak discretionary demand and higher supply chain costs.
                <br><br>
                <hr style="border-color: #ccc;">
                <br>
                Week of November 25th
                <br>
                <hr style="border-color: #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;">
                Zoom (ZM) beat earnings, posted 4% revenue growth and a 47% increase in net income, with modest quarterly guidance. The company raised its fiscal 2025 outlook, introduced new AI-driven offerings, and announced a rebranding to Zoom Communications, shifting its focus to an AI-first platform for business growth.
                <br><br>
                Crowdstrike (CRWD) beat earnings and reported $1.01B in revenue, driven by strong execution despite a July software outage that impacted its reputation and delayed some deals. The company raised its full-year earnings forecast but issued weaker-than-expected Q4 guidance.
                <br><br>
                Macy's (M) investigated an employee for falsifying delivery expense accounting, resulting in revised financial statements and the individual's dismissal. The company beat earnings, lowered its full-year earnings outlook, and slightly raised its sales forecast.
                <br><br>
                Best Buy (BBY) missed earnings and lowered its full-year sales and comparable sales outlooks due to weaker-than-expected sales in September and October, along with challenging macroeconomic conditions. The company saw declines in appliance, home theater, and gaming sales, though growth in computing, tablets, and services helped offset these declines. Best Buy expects demand to pick up during the holiday season.
                <br><br>
                Dell (DELL) reported strong AI-related sales growth in its Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), but forecasted lower-than-expected Q4 revenue and earnings due to shifting demand for Nvidia’s next-gen AI chips. The company also posted a decline in PC sales and delivered mixed earnings overall.
                <br><br>
                <hr style="border-color: #ccc;">
                <br>
                Week of December 2nd
                <br>
                <hr style="border-color: #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;">
                Royal Bank of Canada (RY) beat earnings and reported an 18% YoY increase in adjusted earnings, driven by the HSBC Canada acquisition, strong client growth, and other factors. Despite this, the bank faces challenges from a weak Canadian economy, including rising unemployment, competitive pressures in mortgage pricing, and higher non-interest expenses.
                <br><br>
                SentinelOne (S) reported 28% revenue growth and a 29% increase in Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR), along with positive TTM free cash flow (FCF), but missed earnings expectations. The company raised its fiscal year 2025 revenue growth outlook to 32% and expects non-GAAP gross margins to remain at 79%. However, it remains unprofitable, with negative operating and FCF margins, and continues to project losses.
                <br><br>
                Salesforce (CRM) reported 8% revenue growth and a 25% increase in net income, while raising its full-year revenue guidance, driven by success in AI-powered products like Agentforce. However, the company posted earnings guidance slightly below expectations and faces pressure to improve profitability, with a growing focus on cost efficiencies. Overall, Salesforce reported mixed earnings.
                <br><br>
                <hr style="border-color: #ccc;">
                <br>
                Week of December 9th
                <br>
                <hr style="border-color: #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;">
                Adobe (ADBE) reported 11% revenue growth, driven by strong demand across its Creative, Document, and Experience Clouds, along with a $2B increase in Digital Media ARR. Despite a $200M headwind from forex impacts, the company beat earnings expectations.
                <br><br>
                Costco (COST) beat earnings and reported strong sales growth, driven by a 13% increase in e-commerce, a 5.1% rise in global traffic, and strong performances in areas like home furnishings and fresh food. Membership revenue also saw a boost from a membership fee increase.
                <br><br>
                Broadcom (AVGO) saw its valuation surge to $1T after projecting AI-related revenue to reach $60B-$90B by 2027. The company also forecasted first-quarter revenue above estimates, driven by strong sales from the growing demand for chips powering AI. However, Broadcom lost business with Ingram Micro, which cited operational inefficiencies and difficulties in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement following Broadcom's acquisition of VMware. As a result, the company reported mixed earnings.
                <br><br>
                <hr style="border-color: #ccc;">
                <br>
                Week of December 16th
                <br>
                <hr style="border-color: #ccc; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;">
                Nike (NKE) focused on returning to growth by ending deep discounting, reducing reliance on promotional sales, and reemphasizing sport and innovation in its product lines. Despite facing challenges such as declining sales, inventory issues, and the impact of shifting focus away from popular styles, the company beat earnings expectations.
                <br><br>
                Accenture (ACN) beat earnings, posted new bookings of $18.7B (including $1.2B from generative AI), and remains optimistic about its prospects due to strong demand for consulting and managed services. While the company faces challenges from currency headwinds and potential market volatility, particularly in APAC, growth in AI-driven solutions continues to drive its performance.
                <br><br>
                Micron Technology (MU) beat earnings expectations, matched revenue estimates, but missed Q2 outlook expectations, causing at least 15 analysts to lower their price targets. Despite short-term weaknesses in the PC and smartphone markets, Micron remains optimistic about long-term growth driven by data centers and HBM for AI applications.
                <br><br>
                FedEx (FDX) announced the spinoff of its less-than-truckload freight division to streamline operations and focus on its core delivery business. The company reported mixed earnings, with a a slight decline in Q2 adjusted profits, and lowered its full-year profit outlook from previous forecasts.
                <br><br>
                <hr style="border-color: #333;">
                <br>
                There aren’t many other notable earnings reports in the next few weeks, but the season is looking to kick back in mid-January (approximately the 15th) as financial institutions will look to report.
