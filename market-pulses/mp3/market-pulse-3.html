            <p>This past week, a slew of economic data was once again released.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In terms of domestic events, the Conference Board’s index of US Consumer Confidence fell to around 98.7 (near the bottom of its range over the past two years), and the index of perception of labor market conditions fell to 81.7 - 80 being the threshold that has historically predicted recessions. However, the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index rose for the second month, from 67.9 in August to 70.1. The housing sector also brought mixed news as new home sales were reported to have declined 4.7% in August and building permits were revised lower on one end, and mortgage rates have been dropping and inducing a surge in refinancing on the other end. On the positive side of the spectrum, the Commerce Department released the core PCE (personal consumer expenditures) index, which rose 0.1% MoM (a tick below expectations) and put the inflation rate at 2.2% YoY, suggesting an easing in inflationary pressures. For reference, the core PCE index excludes potentially volatile and seasonal food and energy prices, and the PCE differs from the CPI as it tracks both rural and urban spending (the CPI only tracks urban expenditures). The US government also released its latest estimate of second-quarter economic growth, finding that GDP expanded at a 3.0% annual rate (higher than the expectations for a 2.9% rate), and weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest figure in four months (approximately 218,000).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s take a closer look at foreign events now. For one, the HCOB Eurozone Composite PMI Output Index fell from 51.0 in August to 48.9 (indicating an economic contraction) as manufacturing declined faster and services activity slowed down from the impact of the Paris Olympics fading. In Germany, the economy is likely on track for a second quarterly drop in output as business activity has declined the most in seven months. While consumer confidence has stabilized at a low level, the business climate index dropped to 85.4 from 86.6 in August and sentiment fell in every sector of the economy apart from construction. Also in Europe, France and Spain released better-than-expected inflation data, and the Swedish and Swiss central banks cut their interest rates by 25 basis points and forecasted that further reductions are still possible in the next two meetings if inflation and economic activity remained unchanged.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Asia also turned out extremely active following recent events as well. For one, Shigeru Ishiba, after proving victorious in a recent election, will be Japan’s next prime minister, and speculation ties his views on fiscal policy toward eliminating deflation and him to a lenient monetary policy approach. In terms of economic data, the Tokyo-area core CPI rose 2.0% YoY (down from 2.4% in August), and PMI data indicated private sector expansion, marginal manufacturing output contraction, and growing activity in the services segment. Across the East China Sea, China recently unveiled measures to shore up the economy, leading Chinese stocks surging for the biggest weekly gain for the benchmark CSI 300 since 2008. The People’s Bank of China on Tuesday announced plans for a stimulus package that will bolster near-term activity by lowering borrowing costs, injecting more funds into the economy, and easing household mortgage repayment burdens. This involves a 50 basis point cut in the required reserves requirement, a 20 basis point seven-day reverse repo rate cut (where banks are encouraged to lend more money to the central bank, which injects liquidity into the economy), a 30 basis point medium-term lending facility rate cut, a nationwide down payment ratio cut from 25% to 15%, issuance of special sovereign bonds worth about RMB 2T ($248.4B), and issuance of special sovereign debt meant to boost domestic consumption worth about RMB 1T ($124.2B).</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s now take a look at the earnings calendar once again.<br><br>Recently, Micron Technologies (MU) beat revenue and EPS expectations, posting much higher operating and free cash flows, 93% YoY revenue growth, robust AI and data center DRAM products demand, and substantial revenue forecasts for Q1 of 2025. Costco (COST) released a mixed earnings report, involving an EPS beat and an extremely marginal revenue miss. Membership fee revenues and comparable sales fell below expectations, but the CFO has stated that the membership fee increase benefits will come in the back half of 2025 and into 2026. Finally, Accenture (ACN) beat EPS and revenue estimates amid its acquisition spree.</p>

            <p>Keep an eye out for these economic events this week: manufacturing data (e.g., PMI, New Orders Index, etc.) and job openings will be released on Tuesday, weekly unemployment claims on Thursday, and jobs and unemployment on Friday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>This week, the S&P 500 ticked up around 0.5%, the Nasdaq Composite up around 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 0.5%, and the Russell 2000 down around 1%.<br><br>The S&P 500 (weighted based on market cap) tracks the 500 largest public companies.<br>The Nasdaq Composite (Weighted based on market cap) tracks the 100 largest, actively traded, non-financial companies.<br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (weighted based on share price) tracks the 30 largest American non-transportation/utility companies.<br>The Russell 2000 (weighted based on market cap) tracks 2000 small-cap equities.<br><br><br>Here is the weekly market heatmap as well.</p>

            <p>Here are a few recent M&A deals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s take a closer look at one in the industrial technology space.<br><br>Nano Dimensions acquired Markforged, and both companies are additive manufacturing companies. The advisors include Greenhill for Nano Dimensions and Evercore for Markforged, and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. It can be viewed as a horizontal integration deal as it will create synergies, expand Nano’s market share, and increase value creation opportunities with a broader 3D printing portfolio. The transaction is worth approximately $475M, will entirely be financed by cash on hand, and will form a combined company that would have revenue of $340M (based on fiscal year 2023) and a clear path to profitability.</p>
