            <p>As a fun fact, the New York Stock Exchange recently announced plans to extend trading on its all-electronic exchange to 22 hours a day. While the current market opens at 4 AM ET and closes at 8 PM ET, this new proposal, subject to regulatory approval, would enable the NYSE Arca electronic exchange to be open from 1:30 AM ET to 11:30 PM ET on weekdays.<br><br>These past two weeks, we witnessed Treasury yields rise, and insights surrounding manufacturing data, the labor market, and growth forecasts were released domestically. Abroad, European economic data was released, the Japanese election took place, and China continued to take measures to shore up its economy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s now take a look at recent domestic economic data.<br><br>For one, the IMF (not the Impossible Mission Force - the International Monetary Fund) increased its 2024 U.S. growth forecasts by 0.2% to 2.8%, citing strong consumption due to rising wages and asset prices. Concerning the labor market, while continuing jobless claims are near a three-year high and recently came in at 1.897M, initial jobless claims came in at 227K (15K below estimates). Thirdly, manufacturing data was also recently released. The S&P Global Flash US Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) came in at 47.8 (up slightly from 47.3 last month), the S&P Global Flash US Services PMI came in at 55.3 (up slightly from 55.2 last month), New Home Sales came in at 738K (up from 709K last month and above expectations of 710K), and Durable Goods Orders came in at +0.4% (above the estimated 0.0%). Finally, the Fed reported little economic growth alongside easing worker demand and moderate inflation in the Beige Book, a summary of economic conditions in each Fed region released eight times a year.<br><br>On a side note, the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index ticked back up to 70.5, up from 68.9 two weeks ago. The index has remained choppy for the past weeks, thus potentially indicating uncertainty in consumer confidence in the economy (for reference, the index is calculated based on survey responses).<br><br>What does the rest of this data mean? It indicates a slightly positive yet mixed outlook for the US economy. Growth forecasts highlight confidence in the economy’s resilience, the contrasting labor market dynamics suggest that new layoffs are not as widespread as feared and point toward a potentially further cooling labor market, the PMI upticks display modest improvement in the manufacturing and services sectors, and the rise in new home sales and durable goods orders shows demand in key sectors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s take a closer look at Treasury yields now, considering that both the 2- and 10-year Treasury yields have climbed following the 50 bps rate cut in September and have thus started to attract investor attention.<br><br>What is fueling the rise in yields? Stronger-than-expected economic data over the past month, a shift in rate-cut expectations, concerns over U.S. debt, and the upcoming election. For one, the cooling labor market, defined by a pivotal point in September’s jobs gains and a drop in unemployment, contributed to dispelling fears of a near-term recession. A recent surprise in inflation, however, has also established expectations for a more gradual rate-cutting cycle. Not only that, but the fast-approaching presidential election on November 5th contributed to short-term volatility and uncertainty in the markets, especially as it has raised fiscal concerns concerning presidential and legislative policy outlooks and our nation’s elevated debt. Historically, similar short and long-term sustainability concerns have led to the U.S. Treasuries being considered a safe haven, but many speculative eyes will now turn to not only the election but also earnings season, further unemployment and inflation readings, and Fed meetings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In terms of foreign economic data, we will focus on Europe, Japan, and China once again.<br><br>In Europe, business activity continues to remain in contractionary territory, employment rates have begun to drop at the fastest rates since 2020, and the Eurozone PMI came in at 49.7 (up from 49.6 last month), with France and Germany, the two largest European economies, being the main sources of weakness. Not only that, but the UK composite PMI came in at an 11-month low of 51.7 (down from 52.6 last month), and consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level this year. As such, the European Central Bank (ECB) is leaning toward lowering rates despite being divided over the pace of policy easing. While some (e.g., ECB President, Germany) are suggesting a cautious approach to the matter, others (e.g., France, Portugal, Finland) are warning of falling behind the curve amidst weakening economic growth.<br><br>In Japan, easing inflationary and political pressures contributed to uncertainty. The Tokyo-area consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.8% YoY (slightly above expectations), pay trends remain sluggish, and the Liberal Democratic Party recently lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 15 years this weekend. The defeat has primarily been attributed to rising living costs, inflation, and a major political funding scandal. However, Shigeru Ishiba, the newly appointed Prime Minister, stated that he plans not to resign and would rather reform the party. This instability may contribute to a short-term weakening of the Yen as investors may seek out more stable investment environments. For example, this news subsequently contributed to a gap down in JPY/USD and a gap up in USD/JPY when Forex markets opened at 10 PM UTC on Sunday.<br><br>In China, the People’s Bank of China injected RMB 700B into the banking system through a medium-term lending facility, maintained the lending rate at 2%, and indicated potential future measures like reductions in the reserve requirement ratio. Chinese banks also reduced their one- and five-year loan prime rates by 25 bps, making loans more affordable for consumers.</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s now take a look at a few notable earnings reports.<br><br>Two weeks ago, financial institutions like Goldman Sachs (GS), Citi (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Bank of America (BAC) shone in the spotlight as banks reported a positive rise in profit from last year and indicated investment banking strength. The banking sector may also serve as an attractive area for investors, especially as the rate-cutting cycle may support lending measures and bolster the merger and acquisition markets as borrowing costs are decreased and potentially allow for more transactions financed through debt. ASML (ASML), TSMC (TSM), and Netflix (NFLX) also reported earnings. ASML reported earnings earlier than expected, revealing a downward revision to the company’s 2025 sales outlook caused by the delays in demand for extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment and slow. TSMC, on the other hand, reported elevated demand for their 3nm and 5nm chips, which helped drive revenue to $23.5B (up 36% from last year), and issued revenue guidance between $26.1B and $26.9B for Q4. Netflix also reported 15% YoY growth in revenue, a leap in operating margins to almost 30%, and improved operational cash flows.<br><br>This past week, Verizon (VZ), Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Motors (GM), Tesla (TSLA), IBM (IBM), Boeing (BA), UPS (UPS), and Southwest Airlines (LUV) also released their earnings reports.<br><br>Verizon (VZ) beat EPS and missed revenue expectations while announcing higher CapEx projections for next year on network expansion efforts.<br><br>Lockheed Martin (LMT) beat EPS and revenue expectations as well while lifting profit and sales forecasts and noting contract and delay challenges in its flagship F-35 program.<br><br>General Motors (GM) beat EPS and revenue expectations while raising guidance and reconfirming plans for shareholder returns and earnings performance next year.<br><br>Tesla (TSLA) surged higher after beating EPS and missing revenue expectations while posting lower costs, better-than-expected profit margins, and positive growth and delivery guidance.<br><br>IBM (IBM) beat EPS and missed revenue expectations while posting an 83% software gross margin and disappointing consulting and infrastructure revenues.<br><br>Boeing (BA) missed EPS and revenue expectations while also facing labor disputes and posting a massive $6B revenue loss and operations that are burning cash on hand.<br><br>UPS (UPS) beat EPS and revenue expectations while also noting slightly higher profit margins.<br><br>Southwest Airlines (LUV) beat EPS and revenue expectations while projecting Q4 revenue growth spurred by robust travel demand and strategic initiatives.<br><br>This coming week, we will close out the month of October with countless interesting reports ahead. Ford (F), SoFi (SOFI), AMD (AMD), Alphabet (GOOGL), Chipotle (CMG), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Eli & Lilly (LLY), Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD), Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC), Apple (AAPL), Uber (UBER), Chevron (CVX), and ExxonMobil (XOM) will all be releasing quarterly earnings. As a fun fact for this earnings season, analysts were expecting the Mag7 to generate third-quarter growth of approximately 18.1%, and the other 493 companies in the S&P were projected to produce growth of 0.1%.</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Not only that, but this coming week, eyes will be on the Eurozone’s GDP and CPI reports on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, and the United States’s PCE index (an inflation gauge similar to CPI that tracks urban and rural spending - whereas the CPI only tracks urban spending) and non-farm payrolls report on Thursday and Friday, respectively.</p>

            <p>Here are a few recent M&A deals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s take a closer look at one in the consumer staples industry.<br><br>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP), a North American beverage company, is acquiring GHOST, a rapidly growing lifestyle brand and energy drink company. Bank of America will be advising KDP while Morgan Stanley will be advising GHOST. The transaction can be viewed as a horizontal integration deal meant to increase Keurig’s market share by expanding its product offerings and reaching new customers. It will also take place in two stages. The first stage involves Keurig purchasing a 60% stake in GHOST through an initial cash investment of $990M, which represents a 3x net revenue multiple on a projected 2024 basis and constitutes cash tax benefits of around $140M that will reduce the overall cost of the deal. Not only that but the deal is expected to be neutral to modestly accretive to adjust EPS starting in 2025 and will be followed by a $250M investment by Keurig to transition existing distribution agreements. The second stage involves Keurig acquiring the remaining 40% in 2028.</p>
