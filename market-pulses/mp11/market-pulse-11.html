                It’s important to track the markets because they can help guide your personal or business investment strategies,

                We have a lot to cover with countless data releases across the globe, but let's quickly review the AI narrative 
                some more, given that earnings season is coming to an end.

                In 2024, the market eyed the future for automation and the correlated vast energy demands, leading to a rally in 
                not only the broader market but also semiconductor and software-related companies, nuclear and other energy-related 
                companies, quantum computing stocks, etc. However, DeepSeek recently challenged that notion and intensified fears 
                over heavy AI CapEx. Nonetheless, the selloff reversed, with estimates of the nation’s total power needs growing and 
                mega-cap tech companies continuing their investments. For example, Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and 
                Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to invest nearly $320B in AI-related infrastructure and technologies this year, which 
                is up 40% from 2024, and other commitments such as the $500B US Stargate project and the EU’s €200B AI bet. With that 
                in mind, it’s also important to note that AI is only a part of a broader trend of global growing power needs, so it will 
                be interesting to see how utilities and energy companies perform, with traditional energy being the focus in the short-term
                 for affordability and reliability and nuclear and other low-carbon energy sources being the focus in the long run.

                Let's now jump over to a review and analysis of global economic conditions, kicking things off with the week starting on February 3rd.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">

                In this particular week, tariff-related volatility and weaker-than-expected economic data, including a soft employment report and 
                declining consumer sentiment, fueled concerns over inflation and the Fed’s decision to maintain restrictive policy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                Since President Trump took office in mid-January, stocks have continued to be hit with tariff-driven volatility, especially as Trump 
                previously announced 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada and 10% levies on Chinese imports, as 
                of February 1st. However, by the end of the following Monday, he agreed to postpone tariffs on Mexico and Canada for thirty 
                days. Nonetheless, concerns that tariffs could fuel short-term inflation remain persistent, as the University of Michigan 
                released February’s preliminary reading of the consumer sentiment index at 67.8, which fell 3.3 points, was below expectations, 
                and was also the lowest level in seven months. With inflation in mind, the Fed, at this point, was likely to hold off on lower rates.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                In addition to tariff-related news, the market also embraced a softer-than-expected employment report. On one hand, the economy 
                added 143,000 jobs in January, below December's revised reading of 307,000 and economists’ expectations for 170,000, and job openings 
                fell to a three-month low of 7.6M in December. On the other, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.0% from 4.1%.
                <br><br>
                As a result of these reports, yields across most maturities decreased, and the US Treasury stated that it aims to lower long-term 
                yields even though large fiscal deficits and persistent inflation may uphold yields. For quick reference, these two can cause 
                demand to rise in the fixed-income space for safer assets, and popular belief is that an increase in demand drives prices up and 
                yields down. However, when it comes to deficit spending and persistent inflation, the story becomes much more complex. With rising 
                deficits, the government must issue more debt and often tends to increase the supply of Treasuries, meaning both supply and demand 
                increase. In addition, new issuance often tends to coincide with longer maturities since short-term debt entails refinancing risks, 
                and this can put upward pressure on yields, given that investors demand higher returns in the long run.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                With that in mind, it will be interesting to see how fiscal deficits evolve in the coming years. So far, we’ve heard that the 
                administration is focused on reducing the federal workforce through severance packages, hiring freezes, and potential agency 
                eliminations. However, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that there may be limited scope for significant costs or 
                significant impact as federal jobs have been declining since the 1960s and only represent 1.9% of all jobs. With federal employees 
                earning an average of $106,500 annually, a 10% reduction would only save 0.5% of the 2025 federal budget ($32B/year). In addition, 
                such reductions will be challenging, considering that defense and securities agencies make up 70% of federal employment, and agencies 
                like the FAA are already understaffed. On the other hand, broader reform efforts, such as initiatives like the Department of 
                Government Efficiency (DOGE), could help trim waste in areas beyond workforce cuts. By scrutinizing federal spending and regulations, 
                the organization may unlock savings over the long term.

                On a short, unrelated note, the ISM PMI report indicated that factory activity in the US expanded in January for the first time 
                in 27 months while services PMI slightly declined MoM to 52.8.

                Let's shift focus from the domestic scene to international developments, where global economic conditions are unfolding differently 
                across regions. Inflation remains an area of concern in the UK and eurozone, and China and Japan are showing mixed signals.

                Tariff risks continue to reinforce preferences for euro-area government bonds, as Europe’s reliance on the US as an export 
                destination means tariffs on both sides would likely hurt growth more than they would boost inflation in the eurozone. With that 
                said, the ECB recently anticipated a rise in inflation, as annual consumer price growth accelerated to 2.5% from 2.4% in December, 
                core inflation remained steady at 2.7%, and service inflation came in at 3.9%.

                On the other hand, the BoE stated that it expects England’s inflation to stay above target until 2027, even though it has made 
                sufficient progress on subduing inflation and wage growth so far. As a result, it recently cut rates by 25 bps to 4.5%, with 7 of the 
                9 officials supporting the 25 bps cut and 2 of the officials favoring a 50 bps cut due to a weakening labor market and slowing consumer 
                demand helping to subdue inflation. With that said, the BoE also halved its economic growth forecast for this year to 0.75%.

                In mainland Europe, while Germany has experienced a modest economic downturn in the past year, a few positive signs have emerged. 
                For one, factory orders jumped 6.9% in December, rebounding from a 5.4% drop in November and exceeding expectations for a 2.0% increase 
                due to sizable expansion in vehicle construction, capital goods, and consumer goods orders. However, looking back at the past year, orders 
                are, strictly speaking, still 3.0% lower YoY, with industrial production having contracted to 2.4% (the lowest level since May of 2020) 
                and automotive output and machine maintenance having dropped around 10%.

                In China, strong consumer spending during the Lunar New Year holiday helped lift the market against President Trump’s decision to 
                impose 10% tariffs on Chinese imports. However, broader economic indicators pointed to continued weakness, with the PMI dropping from 
                52.2 in December to 51 and the manufacturing PMI slowing slightly from 50.5 to 50.1.
                <br><br>
                In Japan, the BoJ is expected to have more flexibility with monetary policy as the Fed pauses its rate cuts, especially as our policies 
                have recently been moving in opposite directions and caused large fluctuations in the forex market. It previously stated that it will 
                raise interest rates if the economy, prices, and wages develop in line with forecasts, and so far, this has been the case for the most 
                part. December witnessed a sharp rise in nominal wages and marked the second consecutive month of positive real wage growth, and household 
                spending rebounded more than expected. Nonetheless, recent hawkish statements from officials led the Yen to strengthen and weigh on 
                the profit outlooks of Japan’s export-heavy industries.

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                This particular week, higher CPI and PPI readings, along with a slowdown in January retail sales, reinforced concerns about inflation and 
                restrictive monetary policy, while tariffs remained a continued area of concern.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                While Trump earlier decided not to introduce new global tariffs for the time being and allowed room for negotiation, he signed an 
                executive order that could lead to the implementation of reciprocal tariffs. With inflationary concerns still looming, it’s also 
                important to note the recently hotter-than-expected readings.
                <br><br>
                For one, January’s CPI rose 0.5% MoM and 3.0% YoY, up from December’s 0.4% and 2.9%, respectively. Food and energy prices were meaningful 
                contributors recently, with food prices rising at the fastest monthly pace in two years (e.g., egg prices jumping 15% due to Avian Influenza). 
                Similarly, core inflation (a measure excluding food and energy) ticked higher to 3.3% from 3.2% due to higher goods and services prices, and the 
                PPI rose a slightly more than expected 0.4% MoM, with forecasts previously at a 0.3% increase. As a result, the Fed has reinforced its view of 
                keeping monetary policy restrictive for now. Nonetheless, consumers are likely feeling the short-term strain of cumulative price increases, 
                with fatigue reflected in a slowdown in January retail sales even though other factors like snowstorms and wildfires were potentially at play too.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                Shifting focus to Europe and Asia, the Eurozone saw a drop in industrial production, while the UK experienced unexpected growth. 
                In Japan, rising prices suggest potential rate hikes, and in China, inflation rose but factory deflation continued.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                In the Eurozone, industrial production in December shrank 1.1% sequentially, more than forecasts and as a result of sharp declines 
                in capital and intermediate goods outputs: YoY production was 2.0% lower and capital goods productions fell 8.0%. On a positive 
                note, however, the economy expanded 0.1% QoQ and 0.7% YoY. Similarly, Britain’s economy unexpectedly grew by 0.1% in Q4 of 2024, 
                contrary to forecasts for a 0.1% contraction, and 0.9% in 2024 as a whole, up from 0.3% in 2023.

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>
                In Japan, the BoJ likely will raise rates in the second half of this year. Recent reports also support the case for further monetary 
                policy normalization, with the corporate goods price index, a measure of input prices for Japanese firms, rising 4.2% YoY in January. 
                However, this expansion was, in part, due to the recent agricultural products’ price growth, which exceeded expectations for a 4.0% 
                increase, was up from December’s 3.9% reading, and led the government to release rice from its reserves to explicitly counter soaring prices.
                <br><br>
                Branching off the previous week’s positive consumer-related report fueled by the Lunar New Year Holiday, CPI rose a higher-than-expected 
                0.5% YoY in January and accelerated from December’s 0.1% print in China. On the other hand, the PPI fell 2.3% in January, not only 
                holding steady from December’s reading but also marking the 28th consecutive month of factory deflation.

                Major indices recently dropped after Trump’s tariff announcement, with weak consumer sentiment, declining retail sales,

                Concerning consumer expenditures, Walmart (WMT) recently reported weak guidance and intensified sentiment stemming from the previous 
                week’s weak retail sales report which indicated that they dropped by the most in nearly two years in January. Reflecting this sentiment, 
                the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index for February dropped approximately 10% MoM, and inflation expectations for 
                2025 jumped to 4.3%, up from 3.3% in January.
                <br><br>
                Concerning manufacturing, S&P Global’s flash composite PMI reading came in at a seventeen-month low of 50.4, with services activity 
                entering contractionary territory with its lowest print in over two years (49.7).
                <br><br>
                Extending the negative sentiment, the National Association of Home Builders reported that its housing market index dropped 10.6% MoM 
                in February (from 47 in January to 42, the lowest level in five months) due to uncertainty around tariffs, elevated mortgage rates, 
                and high housing costs. Similarly, January’s housing starts, a measure of the start of construction on new, privately owned homes in 
                the US, declined nearly 10% MoM to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,336,000 too.
                <br><br>
                With that said, the Fed also recently released its most recent minutes, supporting previous weeks’ notions that it is likely to hold 
                rates steady until inflation improves. At this time, municipal bonds posted slightly positive returns, with seasonal reinvestments 
                and a lighter issuance calendar, while investment-grade corporate bonds posted negative returns and heavy issuance. For reference, 
                municipal bonds are often deemed safer, are tax-exempt, offer lower yields compared to corporate bonds, and are issued by state and 
                local governments. On the other hand, investment-grade corporate bonds are generally higher risk, are taxable, offer higher yields 
                compared to municipal bonds, and are issued by companies.

                Shifting from the US economic landscape, Europe, Japan, and China are facing distinct challenges and opportunities, with European 
                business activity continuing to expand despite lingering concerns, Japan seeing inflationary pressures alongside growth, and China 
                showing signs of recovery in its tech sector amidst broader economic strains.

                In Europe, provisional PMIs from S&P Global indicated that business activity remained in expansionary territory for a second consecutive 
                month in February even though weakness remained in new orders, input cost inflation has accelerated, output prices have risen, and 
                staffing levels have fallen. Nonetheless, output in Germany rose for a second consecutive month and the majority of the bloc posted a 
                solid expansion in output, with France being the only one to suffer a sharp output decline.
                <br><br>
                With the broader economy in mind though, European stocks have, so far, rallied, with the STOXX Europe 600 up 8.46% YTD and the German 
                DAX index up 11.30% YTD. In previous years, they’ve been hit with anemic growth, low productivity, and more recently, trade uncertainties. 
                A few countries have been particularly hurt as well. For example, Germany, which accounts for 30% of the Eurozone's GDP, recently faced 
                a manufacturing slump. On a broader scale, international stocks have lagged US stocks in eight of the past ten years, with 2024 marking 
                the largest underperformance since 1998. Nonetheless, while consumer spending and corporate profit trends suggest that US equities may 
                maintain a leading position this year, it will be interesting to see how potential positive catalysts materialize over time (e.g., energy
                price developments, upcoming elections, etc.).

                In the UK, manufacturing, employment, consumer, and inflation-related data were recently released.
                <br><br>
                Concerning manufacturing data, the composite PMI, remained in expansionary territory but declined modestly from January.
                <br><br>
                Concerning the labor market, private sector employment fell the most since November 2020 due to higher payroll costs and weak demand, the 
                unemployment rate remained stable at 4.4% and below the 4.5% forecast.
                <br><br>
                Concerning consumer-related data, retail sales volumes in January surged 1.7% sequentially, the first monthly increase since August and 
                above forecasts for a 0.65% rise due to strong food sales. While the consumer confidence index ticked up in February, it also remained in 
                negative territory due to concerns over jobs and prices. With that said consumer price growth accelerated to 3% in January due to higher 
                transport costs and rising food and nonalcoholic beverage prices, marking the fastest rate since March of 2024 and up from 2.5% in December. 
                Similarly, core inflation picked up to 3.7% from 3.2%, and services inflation remains an area of concern, accelerating to 5.0% from 4.4%. 
                Average wages, however, rose 5.9% YoY, up from 5.6% in the previous quarter.

                Japanese markets were also pressured by tariff threats, with the Yen strengthening, and JGB yields rose to record highs due to further 
                inflationary signals. For reference, core CPI rose 3.2% YoY in January, up from 3.0% in December’s reading and higher than expectations 
                for a 3.1% increase. On a side note, the country’s GDP grew 2.8% YoY and 0.7% QoQ in Q4 of 2024, higher than expectations for a 0.3% rise 
                and up from Q3’s 0.4% reading. With these reports, the BoJ has reiterated its previous statements, claiming that it is eyeing future rate 
                hikes if prices continue to improve, and it is ready to increase its JGB purchases if long-term yields rise sharply to stabilize the market 
                against abnormal moves. For reference, these purchases would raise the demand, and thus the prices, for bonds and reduce yields in the 
                short-run but can also inject more money into the money supply as a countermeasure.

                In China, the market recently gained some ground off strength in the country’s leading tech companies, with President Xi Jinping and other 
                entrepreneurs signaling that the government is adopting a more supportive stance toward private sector companies. In previous years, the 
                tech sector and other industries have faced a crackdown, but recent technological and political developments have underscored the importance 
                of private sector growth, especially as the economy has already been under strain amid a persistent property slump and weak domestic demand. 
                As a side note, Alibaba (BABA), a leading e-commerce and cloud computing company recently reported faster-than-projected sales growth in Q4, 
                and other tech companies also renewed investor sentiment.

                Earnings so far have indicated that profits for the Mag7 are slowing after two years of explosive growth even though results remain strong, with 
                earnings for the group rising 25% in Q4. However, the broadening of market leadership is likely a healthy development as sectors like financials, 
                healthcare, and real estate have picked up and even delivered double-digit profit growth. Overall, though, the S&P 500 is on track for a fantastic 
                earnings season so far, with profits growing 17% YoY, compared to previous expectations for 12% growth.

                Celsius Holdings is set to acquire Alani Nutrition for $1.65B, with $1.275B in cash, $500M in stock, and a potential $25M earn-out tied to 
                2025 performance. The deal, expected to close in Q2 2025, will combine two rapidly growing energy brands, creating a stronger platform in the 
                functional beverage sector. This acquisition is expected to boost Celsius’ sales to around $2B, with $50M in cost synergies over the next two years, 
                and will be funded through $900M in debt and $375M in cash, maintaining strong liquidity.
