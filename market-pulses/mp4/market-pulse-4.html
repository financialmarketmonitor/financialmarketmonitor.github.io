        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>It’s important to track the markets because they can help guide your personal or business investment strategies, understand employment or consumer trends, grasp fiscal and monetary policies, and analyze geopolitical health worldwide.</p>

            <p>These past two weeks, domestic economic data providing insights into our labor market and inflation were released.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% in September, from 4.2% in August, and job gains, also known as nonfarm payrolls, came in above projections at 254,000, with a consensus monthly increase expectation of 140,000. However, weekly jobless claims came in at 258,000 for the week ending October 5, which came in above expectations and is the highest level of initial claims in fourteen months. On a side note, wages also grew 0.4% MoM (4.0% YoY) in September. Regarding the recent inflation readings, the CPI rose at a 2.4% annual rate in September, which is down from August’s 2.5% reading and just above the consensus economic forecast of 2.3%. This has led some (e.g., those at Edward Jones Investments) to anticipate quarter-point rate cuts at each meeting until the Federal Funds Rate settles around 3% - 3.5%.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>This past week also marked the two-year anniversary of the Bull Market. On October 12, 2022, core inflation (which excludes volatile categories of inflation like food and energy) peaked at around 8% while the Federal Reserve was in the midst of an aggressive rate-hiking campaign. Since then, US large caps have risen approximately 60% (24% in the first year and 35% in the second), and historically, the average duration of the last eleven bull markets has been nearly five years, with eight out of eleven making it to the end of the third year. With this in mind, as well as the odds of a recession decreasing and the Federal Reserve embarking on a rate-cutting cycle amid a healthy labor market, we can expect the bull market to continue into its third year. However, it is crucial to be strategic and safe, considering that earnings season has kicked off, valuations are slightly elevated with the S&P 500 P/E ratio coming in approximately at 28-29, and the tense presidential election and geopolitical risks serve as catalysts for short-term volatility.</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In terms of foreign economic data, we will focus on Europe, Japan, and China.<br><br>In Europe, Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action forecasted a 0.2% contraction in their economy and has stated that much stronger consumption would be required to fuel a resurgence in economic growth early in 2025. This comes with a recent report further exemplifying the nation’s weak economic conditions as factory orders dropped 5.8% sequentially in August, which is much sharper than the consensus forecast of a 2.0% decline. On the other hand, a rise in manufacturing and construction output has offset a slight increase in service prices in the UK, with the economy expanding 0.2% in August, following a stagnant period in June and July.<br><br>In Japan, the weakness of the Yen has provided a good backdrop for positive profit outlooks for Japanese exports, especially as Japan’s new prime minister Shigeru Ishiba cautioned that the economy is not ready for an additional interest rate hike. Not only that, but real wages fell 0.6% YoY in August, suggesting a sluggishness in pay trends and thus providing support to the view that the Bank of Japan may hold off on raising interest rates soon.<br><br>In China, optimism regarding Beijing’s stimulus measures remains uncertain, but the National Development and Reform Commission announced that China would speed up countercyclical measures to support growth by boosting investment and increasing direct support to low-income groups and new graduates. These measures include the issuance of ultra-long special sovereign bonds in 2025 to fund major projects, the investment of RMB 100B in strategic areas, and the launching of a RMB 500B swap facility to provide liquidity to institutional investors.</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s take a look at this month’s chaotic but exciting earnings calendar. This past week, financial institutions like JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Blackrock released better-than-expected third-quarter results, including smaller-than-feared declines in third-quarter profits. This coming week will also provide valuable insights into the financial sector as Charles Schwab, Citi, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Blackstone, and American Express will be reporting earnings. Aside from that, Johnson & Johnson, ASML, Netflix, and TSMC will also be reporting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>This coming week, eyes will be on the UK’s CPI report on Wednesday and the release of retail sales and business inventories (by the US Census Bureau) as well as the housing market index (by the National Association of Home Builders) on Thursday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>This past week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Russell 2000 all ticked up around 1.5%.<br><br>The S&P 500 (weighted based on market cap) tracks the 500 largest public companies.<br>The Nasdaq Composite (Weighted based on market cap) tracks the 100 largest, actively traded, non-financial companies.<br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (weighted based on share price) tracks the 30 largest American non-transportation/utility companies.<br>The Russell 2000 (weighted based on market cap) tracks 2000 small-cap equities.</p>

            <p>Here is the weekly market heatmap as well.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Here are a few recent M&A deals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s take a closer look at one in the mining and minerals space.<br><br>Coeur Mining acquired Silvercrest Metals Inc. The advisors include BMO Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC for Coeur and Cormark Securities Inc., Raymond James Ltd., & Scotiabank for Silvercrest. It can be viewed as a horizontal integration deal meant to increase Coeur’s market share while also enhancing efficiencies and strengthening its overall business portfolio. The combined company is projected to generate approximately $700M in EBITDA and $350M in free cash flows in 2025, and it is expected to produce approximately 21 million ounces of silver in 2025, which is approximately worth $650M (as of the current price per ounce of silver of $31.10). For comparable reference, the combined market cap of Coeur and Silvercrest combined is around $4B. Overall, the deal is valued at $1.7B and is financed through equity as SilverCrest shareholders will receive approximately 1.6 Coeur common shares for every Silvercrest common share. Not only that, but the current premium based on this exchange ratio sits at 18% based on the 20-day volume-weighted average prices of both companies at the close on October 3rd. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Here are a few other recent notable events: Kalshi became the first and only legal platform in the US to offer betting on elections, Tesla shares ticked down after the Robotaxi and Optimus unveiling event, and the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index ticked down around 1.75% to 68.9 (from 70.1 last month). On a final note and as more of a fun fact, it has also been noted that S&P 500 companies completed a total of $878B buyback spending deals in the trailing twelve months for June 2024, which is up 8% YoY.</p>
