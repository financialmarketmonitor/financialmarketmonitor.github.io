        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>It’s important to track the markets because they can help guide your personal or business investment strategies, understand employment or consumer trends, grasp fiscal and monetary policies, and analyze geopolitical health worldwide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>This past week, the FOMC Meeting on Wednesday served as a key event, not only for the week but for monetary policy as a whole. The Federal Reserve announced a 50 basis point rate cut, which is notable as it is the first cut in four years (since March 2020) and the typical cut is 25 basis points. The bond market will benefit from this due to the allure of stable assets. For one, many will be reallocating their funds to bonds to avoid the risk of upcoming and unknown inflation and labor data upsetting the market. When interest rates fall, newly issued bonds typically offer lower yields while existing bonds with higher fixed coupon rates become more attractive, hence why demand rises. Not only that, but mortgage rates, tied to the bond market, tend to drop as well.<br><br>Let’s look at the impact rate cuts have on equities. They may lower borrowing costs and thus reduce debt servicing costs, encourage consumer spending, allow for higher stock valuations due to lower discount rates, and stimulate corporate investment. The type of companies to keep an eye on as a result of such effects include, but are not limited to, growth-oriented ones as they rely heavily on borrowing to finance expansion, consumer-focused ones due to higher consumer spending, and real estate-focused ones as lower mortgage prices boost the housing market and homebuilders.<br><br>In terms of other domestic economic data, the Commerce Department reported a 0.1% rise in retail sales on Tuesday and a 4.9% rise in building permits MoM (biggest monthly gain in a year), both of which are more than expected and indicate signs of life in consumer spending and the housing sector. However, Thursday brought mixed news, with a downside surprise in weekly jobless claims (continuing claims fell to their lowest level in three months) and an unexpected decline of existing home sales to 2.5%.<br><br>In terms of foreign economic data, England, Japan, and China all released news too. The Bank of England decided to keep interest rates flat at 5% after headline annual inflation in England was reported at 2.2% (unchanged from July) and service prices ticked up. The Bank of Japan chose to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.25% after  CPI rose in line with expectations at 2.8% YoY and after Japanese equities benefited from the US rate cut while the Yen weakened. China saw industrial production rise 4.5% YoY and the unemployment rate move to 5.3% amid lagging forecasts due to weaker commodity prices and auto sales and lower retail sales and fixed-asset investments.</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Now let’s take a look at a few projections for interest rates, inflation, unemployment, and market performance. The median forecast for interest rates includes two more 25 basis point cuts by the end of the year, with a benchmark FFR of 4.4%. The 2025 benchmark currently is 3.4%, and the 2026 benchmark is 2.9%. The Federal Reserve believes that inflation is moving toward its modest 2% target and the labor market is good as they project the unemployment rate to be 4.4% and inflation to be 2.3% by the end of the year. These forecasts differ from those from June, highlighting a 4% unemployment rate and a 2.6% inflation rate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>On a side note, the bond market indicator that is often cited as a gauge of recessionary prospects is no longer indicating a high potential for an economic downturn. Since mid-2022, two-year US treasury note yields have been higher than ten-year treasury bill yields, a rare occurrence known as yield curve inversion. The two-year yield, however, crossed below the ten-year yield on September 4th and has continued to remain below it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In terms of market performance, rate-cutting cycles with no coinciding recession generally have led to equity returns in the past, so hopes are for such a pattern to continue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s now take a look at the earnings calendar once again.<br>Recently, General Mills (GIS) beat EPS and revenue expectations while net sales and operating profits fell, Darden Restaurants (DRI) missed both expectations even though Olive Garden (a subsidiary of Darden) announced a partnership with Uber for deliveries, and FedEx (FDX) missed both expectations and reduced forecasts due to a weak industrial economy and a decline in property shipping volume. Future reports I will be watching include Micron Technology (MU) and Costco (COST).</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In terms of economic events this week, the PCE Index (Personal Consumption Expenditures) will be released on Friday. It is also an inflation metric that differs from the CPI as it tracks both urban and rural spending while the CPI tracks only urban spending.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>This week, the S&P 500 ticked up around 1%, the Nasdaq Composite up around 2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 1%, and the Russell 2000 up around 2%.<br><br>The S&P 500 (weighted based on market cap) tracks the 500 largest public companies.<br>The Nasdaq Composite (Weighted based on market cap) tracks the 100 largest, actively traded, non-financial companies.<br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (weighted based on share price) tracks the 30 largest American non-transportation/utility companies.<br>The Russell 2000 (weighted based on market cap) tracks 2000 small-cap equities.<br><br><br>Here are the top 10 largest gainers in the losers in this past week, and what you are seeing are 5-minute charts.<br><br>The biggest gainer was Innovative Eyewear Inc. (LUCY) which kicked off its run at $5 on September 16th and landed below $11 on September 20th. It is a Florida-based company that specializes in ophthalmic goods and rose as a result of issuing new Series C and D warrants, announcing a strategic partnership with shopping developer Geenee Inc., launching their Lucyd Lyte frames on Target.com, enacting a 1:20 reverse stock split, and expanding their common stock offering.<br><br>The biggest loser was JBDI Holdings Limited (JBDI), a holding company with speculation as to why the enormous drop occurred after an IPO priced at $5/share on August 27th.</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s take a closer look at one in the Entertainment Industry.<br><br>Flutter Entertainment PLC (FLUT) will be acquiring Snaitech, a gaming and betting concessionary and subsidiary of Playtech PLC. Flutter was advised by Arthur Cox and Chiomenti, and Playtech was advised by BCLP. The deal is expected to close near the end of the second quarter of 2025 and can be viewed as a horizontal integration. It is immediately accretive to EPS and is meant to grow Flutter’s online market share, boost brand recognition, and integrate resources like technology and procurement. The deal will also deliver operating cost synergies of at least €70M through streamlined procurement processes and by combining Snai’s platform and Flutter’s infrastructure for online operation efficiency.</p>
