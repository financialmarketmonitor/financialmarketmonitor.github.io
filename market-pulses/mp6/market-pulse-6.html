            <p>Welcome to Market Pulse 6!</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>It’s important to track the markets because they can help guide your personal or business investment strategies, understand employment or consumer trends, grasp fiscal and monetary policies, and analyze geopolitical health worldwide.</p>

            <p>These past three weeks, the US presidential election took place and heavily affected both domestic and global markets, the Fed cut rates by 25 bps, treasury yields rose, insights on manufacturing, inflation, and retail sales were released, and several corporations reported earnings. Abroad, GDP-related data was released in Europe and Japan, and inflation data and retail sales were released in China.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s now take a look at the recent US presidential election, its direct impacts on the markets, and its potential implications for further growth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>To begin with, Donald Trump recently won with 58% of the electoral votes (312) and 50% of the popular vote (≈76.4M), and the Republican Party won both the House and Senate majority. Prior to the election, Goldman Sachs’ prime brokerage data showed that the “fundamental long/short hedge fund crowd took down their gross exposures or essentially their overall risk to both their longs and their shorts to the lowest levels since March of 2023”. In terms of a direct positive impact after, US indices (the S&P, Nasdaq, and Dow) and sectors linked to deregulation (e.g., financials, traditional energy, and utilities) all gapped up the day after the election and rallied before pulling back this past week. Not only that, but as a result of Elon Musk’s support for Trump and Trump’s support for Crypto, we also witnessed Tesla (TSLA) and Bitcoin (BTCUSD) surge 47.68% to $358.65 and 37% to $93,529.95 from their closing prices the day before the election, respectively. Tech stocks also performed well, along with less underperformance in Europe and China than expected, and while foreign tariffs are expected, these are being counteracted economically especially in China by their stimulus measures and policy easing. Conversely, VIX (the volatility index commonly termed as the “fear gauge”) and sectors linked to regulation (e.g., renewable energy) gapped down the day after the election, and the healthcare sector in particular fell sharply after Trump nominated RFK Jr., a vocal critic of the pharmaceutical industry and public health programs, to head the Health and Human Services Department.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s briefly talk about policies now, considering that these are what will truly impact the markets. On one hand, optimism persists on the hopes that individual and corporate tax cuts and deregulation will boost economic growth, support corporate spending and profits, and accelerate deal-making. A large component of Trump’s economic campaign revolves around extending individual tax cuts. On the other hand, tariff and debt concerns have grown on considerations that they must result in increased deficit spending as a result of tax cuts, push prices up, hurt big-tech (especially semiconductor firms relying on imports/exports), and potentially lead to higher inflation and interest rates.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>With these factors in mind, expectations are for momentum in sectors linked to regulation and potentially for the markets to perform well in the next two months. This is primarily due to optimism in governmental policies and due to November and December being the best seasonals in the equity market. For one, November is the strongest month for passive flow like corporate buybacks. Goldman Sachs is going as far as to model $5-6B a day in buybacks this month! Both months are also accompanied with a holiday season that brings along higher consumer spending and deal flow and thus generates more revenue for businesses. We can expect speculation to ramp up once again at the start of the next earnings season in January, but economic data and corporate, economic, and/or political news may always unexpectedly shift the markets in the near-term. Longer-termed projections, however, are going to be subject to incoming economic data and policy proposals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Speaking of economic data, the Fed recently cut rates by 25 bps and brought its policy rate to 4.5% - 4.75%, but other recently released metrics may put a temporary pause in the rate-cutting cycle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>For one, headline CPI ticked up 0.2% MoM while core inflation remained at 3.3%. This involves baskets like energy, gasoline, certain foods, and new vehicle prices falling but areas like housing and rent prices remaining elevated. Also, headline PPI rose 0.2% MoM and 2.4% YoY. Despite these inflation metrics coming in line with October expectations for the most part, Jerome Powell recently indicated a more gradual approach to rate cuts and said that “the economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates”. Not only that, but looser fiscal policy headed by the Trump Administration may also lead the Fed to move even more slowly. Apart from inflation, retail sales topped expectations and rose 0.4% MoM, with September’s readings also being revised upward with new data, and unemployment claims fell to their lowest level in six months this past Thursday.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Despite the uncertainty with regard to fiscal and monetary policy and recent data, long-term market performance is still likely, considering that the economy has come back from the brink of a recession over the last two years and been driven by consumer spending and robust technological innovation, a cooling labor market, rising corporate profits and optimism, and slow but steady improvements in inflation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In terms of foreign economic data, we will focus on Europe, Japan, and China once again, all of which are facing mixed conditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In the UK, GDP came in at 0.1%, below expectations of 0.2% and down 0.4% QoQ, and the economy slowed down. This was accompanied with weaker manufacturing output, 0.1% QoQ growth in the services sector, and 0.8% QoQ in the construction sector. Not only that, but annual wage growth came in at the lowest level in more than two years, and economists are saying that inflation pressures remain too high for the 2% target. On the other hand, the rest of Europe is looking for a recovery with GDP expanding at 0.4% in Q3, its growth projections coming in at 0.8%, and employment rising by 0.2% in Q3. The European Central Bank also recently supported the October rate cut, noting that it was a form of managing risk against an undershooting of the inflation target, especially as they believed disinflation was becoming stronger.<br><br>In Japan, uncertainty with regard to the extent of Trump’s tariffs remain, especially as companies that serve as heavy exporters to the US would be directly affected. In terms of data, GDP grew 0.2% QoQ, which is down 0.3% from Q2 but driven by increased private consumption, and the economy grew 0.9% YoY.<br><br>In China, tariffs also remain focal points, but the economy still remains highly mixed. CPI rose 0.3% YoY and 0.1% MoM, which is still below expectations due to lower food and energy prices, but core inflation increased 0.2% YoY and 0.1% MoM. PPI fell 2.9% YoY, which is 0.4% more than estimates and 0.1% more MoM. On the other hand, retail sales expanded 4.8% YoY and 1.6% MoM, marking the strongest growth since February, and industrial production rose 5.3% YoY but fell 0.1% MoM due to weaker auto sales. Not only that, but the urban employment rate ticked down 0.1% MoM to 5%. All in all, a blend of signals indicate a mild economic slowdown, positive consumer spending and industrial production, and mixed labor market shifts, all of which may point toward a potential shift from previous downturns and thus a positive impact from the stimulus measures that have been taken since September.</p>

            <p>This coming week, Walmart (WMT), Lowe’s (LOW), NVIDIA (NVDA), Snowflake (SNOW), Target (TGT) will be releasing quarterly earnings. While there may not be as much volume in reports compared to previous weeks, these companies will immensely impact the overall market and their correlated sectors. On one hand, Walmart, Lowe’s, and Target will provide likely insights in the consumer space both before and after the Holiday season. On the other hand, Snowflake and, even more so, NVIDIA will not only provide insights in the tech sector, specifically the semiconductor and cloud business, but also immensely impact the market as a whole, especially as it is riding on big tech names as the AI hype continues.</p>

            <p>Let’s take a closer look at one in the healthcare industry.<br><br>GHO Capital Partners, a healthcare investment advisor, and Ampersand Capital Partners, a middle-market private equity firm, are acquiring Avid Bioservices (CDMO), a CDMO focused on the development of CGMO manufacturing of biologics. In other words, Avid helps companies develop and produce biologic drugs like cell and gene therapies). Moelis & Co will be advising Avid while William Blair will be advising GHO and Ampersand. The transaction can be seen as an investment transaction, unlike typical vertical and horizontal integration deals, that is valued at $1.1B (a 6.3x multiple). GHO and Ampersand will acquire CDMO at $12.50 per share, which is a premium to the share price prior to the deal announcement and adds immediate cash value to CDMO’s stockholders’ shares, and employ their experienced services and capital to better position Avid for the future.</p>
