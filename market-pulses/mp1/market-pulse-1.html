            <p>It’s important to track the markets because they can help guide your personal or business investment strategies, understand employment or consumer trends, grasp fiscal and monetary policies, and analyze geopolitical health worldwide.</p>

            <p>In August, three overarching topics dominated the market and fueled recession fears. These include the Yen Carry Trade, weak economic data, and the SAHM rule being triggered. However, such worries were slightly subdued due to considerations of an aggressive September rate cut.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s take a look at the three topics a little more closely.<br><br>The Yen Carry Trade involves borrowing a low-interest currency (like the Yen ), converting it to a higher-interest currency (like the USD), and purchasing high-yield assets (such as US-backed securities). This will ensure profit unless the Yen yield goes up or the USD yield goes down, which correlates with the YEN/USD going down and USD/YEN going up. However, what connected this type of trade with the meltdown? The Bank of Japan raised its interest rates by 25 basis points, leading to an unwind of carry trade positions, a spike in the VIX index, a global equity sell-off, and a bond market rally.<br><br>We also received weak economic data from July.<br><br>The PMI (Purchasing Managers Index), which tracks economic trends (e.g., inventories, backlogs, orders, etc.) in the Manufacturing and Services sector fell 3.5% MoM.<br><br>The New Orders Index, which tracks the change in the volume of new orders received by manufacturers fell 4% MoM.<br><br>The Production Index, which tracks levels of production in manufacturing, mining, gas, and electric industries fell 5.4% MoM.<br><br>Only 114,000 new jobs were added, which was 35% less than unexpected, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, which was the highest since October of 2021, triggering the SAHM rule. The rule predicts recessions when the 3-month moving average of the unemployment rate exceeds its lowest level from the past 12 months. However, some consider it outdated in the post-pandemic era, and the creator of the rule, at the time, said that it may not apply to what was happening.</p>

            <p>Here is the heatmap of the stock market on August 5th, a frightful day for many that led to many portfolios ‘bleeding’.</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Now, let’s take a look at a few notable earnings reports from August. We saw multiple large corporations, some of which are tech-based, beat EPS and revenue expectations, but one prevailing theme investors absorbed was increased CapEx in AI. For example, “Amazon [(AMZN)] spent $30.5 billion on capital expenditures in the first half of the year”, and other companies including, but not limited to, Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) all posted a surge in capital expenditure and cited AI demand as a driver for growth.<br><br>Let’s take a look at a few of the opinions surrounding Nvidia’s (NVDA) monumental earnings. Some believed that the stock had already priced in the earnings while others brought slowing expectations into light: while the company had beat analyst expectations out of the water and raised guidance extensively in the past, they had raised guidance once again to a lesser magnitude.</p>

            <p>This week, the S&P 500 ticked up around 3%, the Nasdaq Composite up around 5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 2%, and the Russell 2000 up around 4%.<br><br>The S&P 500 (weighted based on market cap) tracks the 500 largest public companies.<br>The Nasdaq Composite (Weighted based on market cap) tracks the 100 largest, actively traded, non-financial companies.<br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (weighted based on share price) tracks the 30 largest American non-transportation/utility companies.<br>The Russell 2000 (weighted based on market cap) tracks 2000 small-cap equities.<br><br><br>Here are the top 10 largest gainers in the losers in this past week, and what you are seeing are 5-minute charts.<br><br>The biggest gainer was Instil Bio Inc. (TIL) which kicked off its run at $13 on September 9th and landed at $92 on September 16th. It is a biotech company with a price target from Baird of $180, and its magnificent run was fueled by therapy developments in PD-L1xVEGF.<br><br>The biggest loser was Ryde Group (RYDE), a holding and ride-hailing company with speculation as to why the enormous drop occurred after unexpected volume drove prices up starting on September 3rd.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In terms of earnings reports for September, here are a few notable ones.<br><br>Recently, Broadcom (AVGO) beat earnings and posted upbeat AI revenue guidance, and Oracle (ORCL) recently also beat earnings, announced a partnership with AWS, and posted a rosy AI-cloud revenue forecast.<br><br>Three of the upcoming earnings reports I will be watching include FedEx (FDX), Micron Technology (MU), and Costco (COST).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Now, let’s take a look at September’s economic calendar.<br><br>The jobs report in early September supported notions of a rate cut as 142,000 new jobs were added, which is 23,000 below estimates, but the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2% (from 4.3%), indicating a cooling labor market.<br><br>This past Wednesday, The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released a mixed CPI report, consisting of a rise in core inflation and CPI (0.2% MoM and 2.5% YoY - which is the smallest annual increase since February of 2021). For reference, the CPI determines inflation by calculating the prices on a fixed basket of goods while core inflation removes the CPI components that can exhibit large amounts of volatility MoM, such as food and energy.<br>Investors now look to the FOMC Meeting this Wednesday at 2 PM to hear the Federal Reserve’s decision regarding potential rate cuts, and PCE will be reported next Friday. The PCE is also an inflation metric that tracks spending in urban and rural areas (while the CPI tracks it only in urban areas).</p>

            <p>Here are a few recent M&A deals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let’s take a closer look at one in the Tech Industry.<br><br>Progress Software (PRGS) will be acquiring ShareFile, a business unit of Cloud Software Group, Inc. Progress was advised by Citibank, and Cloud Software was advised by Jefferies Group and Barclays. The deal is expected to close near the end of November and can be viewed as a horizontal integration. It connects AI software and content collaboration to expand Progress’ customer base and revenue stream and thus support their Total Growth Strategy. It is valued at $875M, will be funded through cash and a credit facility, and is expected to add over $240M and 86,000 thousand customers to Progress. In addition, to prioritize debt repayments, Progress will be temporarily suspending dividends after the acquisition.</p>

        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>On a final note, let’s take a look at a few other recent events.<br><br>Election speculation and the recent debate between Trump and Harris currently dominate the political space, and it’s rumored that the markets moved toward a greater probability of a Harris victory. In terms of both campaigns, Trump plans to cut corporate taxes and is tougher on tariffs, while Harris plans to raise corporate taxes and give tax deductions to small businesses. While a wider budget deficit is expected either way, analysts speculate that Trump’s presidency could be negative for oil prices (due to a projected surge in drilling for oil) and will help larger corporations while Harris’ presidency could boost large-cap growth and tech stocks (due to the difference in views in tariffs and due to Biden’s CHIPS act) but hurt larger corporations.<br><br>In terms of the AI narrative, Jensen Huang continues to emphasize the coalescence between a limited supply and significant demand for GPUs and AI-related technology. While Nvidia (NVDA) can consider switching to alternative suppliers from TSMC, due to geopolitical and supply fears, they would need to sacrifice quality. Nonetheless, Huang touts a rapidly growing production line for Blackwell GPUs.<br><br>In terms of macroeconomics, we await the Federal Reserve’s, Bank of England’s, and the Bank of Japan’s decisions regarding domestic interest rates this week. On a side note, the Yen continued to strengthen against the dollar recently, and recent Chinese economic data has indicated a slowdown in industrial output and retail sales.</p>
