            <p>Welcome to Market Pulse 8! I hope you (and your portfolio) had a wonderful holiday and 2024 in general!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>It’s important to track the markets because they can help guide your personal or business investment strategies, understand employment or consumer trends, grasp fiscal and monetary policies, and analyze geopolitical health worldwide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let's run through a brief overview of 2024 and cover these past two weeks, while focusing on mixed economic data worldwide and the fixed income market.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>2024 witnessed strong returns, with headlines dominated by conflicts, the AI narrative, the soft vs hard landing debates, and the US election domestically. The S&P set 57 record highs and achieved its second consecutive year of 20%-plus performance for the first time since 1998. Small caps also rose 12.2%, mainly due to optimism with regard to the presidential election and the potential deregulation and corporate tax cuts to be brought by the Trump Administration. In addition, global high yield bonds benefited from central bank cutting cycles and low default levels, commodities experiences modest gains while some like LNG and Gold performed exceptionally, and cash yields proved strong even though the continued (yet slower) rate cutting cycle to come in 2025 while cause it to moderate. Abroad, APAC's key topics included the Yen's weakness, China's stimulus measures, and Taiwanese developments and tensions. In Europe, a few economic downturns dictacted the markets and the Eurozone's stability. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Unlike what we usually do, let's go over the fixed income market, which has been stimulated by the rate cutting cycle launched in September, credits spreads, and, of course, varying yields. US invesmtent-grade bonds have lagged as yields rose, while international bonds benefited from global central bank cuts in a few nations. US high-yield bonds performed well due to strong economic growth and tigtening spreads, and cash outperformed intermediate-term and investment-grade bonds, despite a recent 100 bps drop in yields. In addition, US municipal bonds saw mixed results, with high supply limited the impact of strong demand, while high-yield municipals benefited from robust consumer spenidng and rising asset values.<br><br>On a side note, the Fed has pointed to a slower, but still existant, cycle of cuts for 2025, where labor market tightening or inflationary worries may reduce the need for them and deteriation in growth outlooks may encourage them. So far, the labor market has cooled and inflation has moderated, but growth insights, future governmental policies and future economic data or geopolitical events will, of course, steer the way for monetary policy.<br><br>With that in mind, it's good to note that, with rate cuts, cash yields are likely to fall more than intermediate and long-term bond yields, the yield curve is likely to steepen, and the advantage of bonds over cash is likely to widen. When rates fall, bond prices typically appreciate, but on more of a specific note, intermediate-term bonds may be preferred over long-term ones as they may be less suscpetible to widening deficits. With deficits leading to higher debt over time, long-term bonds may be considered riskier, but this is partly due to the proposed extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which may expand deficits if not offset by economic growth or spending cuts. This, of course, is only a closer look at bonds; we may cover spreads in another report.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Let's now jump to domestic economic data releases in the past two weeks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>On December 23rd, consumer confidence was reported to have fallen in December around 7.81% MoM to 104.7, with consumers' short-term outlook for business, income, and labor market conditions sharply dropping by approximately 13.45% to 81.1. On the same day, the reading for the new orders for durable goods decline 1.1%, on the contrary of an expected 0.2% rise, due to lower-than-expected commercial aircraft orders and defense spending. Not only that, but November's new home sales also came in slightly below expectations. The next week, while weekly jobless claims declined slightly to 219,000, continuing claims rose to 1.91M, the highest since late 2021.<br><br>In the last week of December, data releases may have been low in volume but certainly were extremely negative. Chicago, for one, released their city-specific PMI, which plummeted from a November reading of 40.2 and expectation of 42.9 to 36.9 in December, marking not only the 13th consecutive month of contracting actvivity but also the steepest MoM drop since May. While not indicative of he entire nation, the city remains a financial and manufacturing powerhouse, so this is definitely concerning in the short-run. In addition, Atlanta's Fed revised Q4 GDP forecasts much lower, from 3.1% to 2.6%, following reduced expectations for real gross private domestic investment growth from 1.3% to -0.7%. The slight positive note we received in the past week was initial jobless claims dropping to 211,000, the lowest level in eight months, and continuing claims falling for the prior week to a three-month low of 1.84M.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>While not specifically macroeconomic data, it may also be prudent to note that Tesla reported Q4 deliveries that failed to meet expectations, and Apple has suffered declining iPhone shipments to China and has thus begun offering discounts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>Abroad, let's look at the UK and Spain a little more closely in Europe and Japan and China in APAC.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In the UK, worries about the economy stalling continue as estimates for its Q3 and Q2 economic growth were revised slightly lower. However, the country's housing market doesn't seem to be faring badly, with the housing price index exceeding expectations for a 0.1% increase and rising 0.7% MoM in December and 4.7% YoY, the most since 2022.<br><br>In Spain, CPI, unfortunately, came in stronger than forecasted for November, with non-seasonally adjusted annual inflation accelerating to 2.8% from 2.4% and core inflation rising to 2.6% from 2.4%. As such, calls for gradual rate cuts by the ECB have been raised, but others have also pointed out that inflation was on track to hit the target rate for the Eurozone this year and that rising energy prices and potential tariffs with the US justified waiting longer. On that note, it's important to note that Trump recently stated that the EU needs to “make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas … Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way”.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-carousel-slide">
            <p>In Japan, near-term rate hikes remain on the table, even though extreme precaution would be required to balance policies and ensure that inflation doesn’t accelerate beyond the target rate. In terms of data, the Tokyo-area CPI rose an above-forecast 3% YoY while core CPI (excluding volatile food and energy prices) rose 2.4% YoY, industrial production fell 2.3% (compared to estimates of a 3.5% decline), retail sales rose a better-than-expected 1.8%, the unemployment rate remained steady at 2.5%, and recent PMI readings indicated that manufacturing activity contracted for a sixth straight month in December due to higher labor and material costs that fueled rising input and output prices.<br><br>In China, stimulus measures to bolster the economy seem to continue to be the primary task at hand. So far, the BoC has injected RMB 300B into the banking system through its medium-term lending facility and has left the lending rate unchanged at 2%. However, the nation continues to face a few downward pressures. It recently reported that manufacturing profits extended declines, with profits at industrial firms falling for the fourth consecutive month and 7.3% YoY in November. Services and manufacturing activity were also slightly mixed. While factory activity expanded for the third consecutive month and non-manufacturing PMI, which measures construction and services, came out better than expected, the official manufacturing PMI slowed MoM and missed forecasts. Similarly, the Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI slowed MoM and lagged forecasts. On a positive note and similar to the UK, the housing market seems to be slightly recovering though. New Home sales rose 24.2% MoM, and the value of new home sales by the top 100 developers stayed flat YoY in December, compared to November’s 6.9% drop.</p>

            <p>Let’s take a closer look at one in the tech sector, but this time, we shall deviate from our typical structure of analysis and highlight NVIDIA's Run:AI acquisition.<br><br>Run:AI is an business that focuses on addressing the growing demand for computational power to accelerate AI models by providing infrastructure and software tools designed to optimize machine learning and deep learning workloads. NVIDIA, as we know, is a GPU powerhouse. The company is pioneering the way for GPU-accelerated computing and specializes in gaming, visualization, data center, and automotive spaces.<br><br>The acquisition is meant for NVIDIA to gain greater control over the AI ecosystem across multiple markets by strengthening its AI-focused product lineup and enhance its resource and workload efficiencies. On a side note, regulatory challenges also needed to be addressed, with the European Commission concluding that the deal would not harm competition in the AI and GPU industries.</p>
